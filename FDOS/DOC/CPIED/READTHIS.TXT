============================================================

1. Description

This program is a CPI file editor. It can edit CPI files
which are used by DOS to store codepage information.
Released under the terms of the
GPL 3 license (see ccopying.txt)

============================================================

2. System requirements

The program should be able to run on any IBM-PC compatible
computer* with an IBM-VGA compatible video card and DOS** or
Windows*** operating system or a DOS emulator****. To save
CPX files UPX (upx.sourceforge.net) must be installed

**The program should run on any DOS that is not older than
3.3. It was tested on following systems:
 MS-DOS  3.3  - no problems
 PC-DOS  3.3  - no problems
 MS-DOS  4.0  - no problems
 MS-DOS  4.01 - no problems
 MS-DOS  5.0  - no problems
 MS-DOS  6.0  - no problems
 MS-DOS  6.2  - no problems
 MS-DOS  6.21 - no problems
 MS-DOS  6.22 - no problems
 MS-DOS  7.1  - no problems
 FreeDOS 1.0  - no problems
 FreeDOS 1.1  - no problems
 PTS-DOS 6.8  - no problems, but in "safe mode" there is a
                small display bug and cpx2cpi crashes the
                system

***The program should run without problems on any DOS-based
version of Windows. It was tested on following systems:
 Windows 3.11 for workgroups - no problems
 Windows 98 SE               - no problems
 
There can be problems in NT-based versions of windows:

 On windows XP there can be display errors with some video
 cards. It was tested on computers with Windows XP SP3 and
 on some of them there were display errors. Propably, the
 video card drivers are responsible for this.

 On Windows Vista and 7, the system may refuse to launch
 this program (or any other fullscreen DOS program) or not.
 It depends on the video card driver.

 On 64 bit systems the program will not run.

****The program was tested on DOSBox 0.63 and 0.73 and there
were no problems. The previous version of the program (1.0)
does not run on DOSBox 0.63. No other emulators were tested.

The program is not tested on all of the systemsafter every
update!

============================================================

3. Features and limitations

The following file formats are supported:

1.FONT - used by MS-DOS, PC-DOS, Windows 1.x, 2.x, 3.x.
2.FONT.NT - used by Windows NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7.
  This format is not fully supported. Files can be loaded in
  this format, but can only be saved in FONT format.
  Windows supports both formats, so this is not a problem.
3.CPX - used by FreeDOS. To save CPX files
  UPX (upx.sourceforge.net) must be installed

The following file formats are not supported:

4.DRFONT - used by DR-DOS

Loaded files must meet the following restrictions:
1.Number of all codepages cannot be 0 or bigger than 16.
2.Codepages must have different numbers.
3.Codepages cannot contain 0 or more than 3 fonts.
4.Width of characters in a font must be equal to 8.
5.Height of characters in font must be equal to 8, 14 or 16
6.Fonts in a codepage must have different heights
7.Fonts must contain exactly 256 characters
8.All fonts must be screen fonts, not printer fonts.

The following actions can be performed:
 1.creating a new CPI
 2.loading a CPI file
 3.saving a CPI file
 4.loading a codepage into VGAmemory using the mode command*
 5.editing the appearance of characters
 6.creating a new codepage
 7.changing a number of an existing codepage
 8.deleting an existing codepage
 9.creating a new font
10.deleting an existing font

*4 a CPI file is saved and used as a parameter to the DOS
   "mode" command which loads a codepage into the video card
   memory:

   mode con:cp prep=((number) path)
   mode con:cp sel=number
  
   This will not work if mode.com or display.sys are
   not installed on the system. It will also not work on
   Windows XP or newer or DOS 3.3. DOS will not be able to
   load the codepage if the CPI file is bigger than 64KB. Do
   not use this option if the codepage is not finished
   because you will not be able to read anything you type
   anymore.
   
============================================================

4. Controls

Everything can be controlled by the keyboard or mouse (if
there is a mouse installed).

============================================================

7. Known bugs

============================================================

8. Compiling, installing

Compiling:

Requirements:
 cpx2cpi:
  ASM
  Turbo C
 cpied:
  Open Watcom

The makefile should be processed by a make program.
I used Borland's make, the real-mode version, makeR. Open
Watcom's wmake doesn't compile cpx2cpi.

Installing:

cpied.exe and cpx2cpi.com should be copied to somwere in the
%PATH%.

On Windows you may register *.cpi and*.cpx file extensions
to CPIED.
