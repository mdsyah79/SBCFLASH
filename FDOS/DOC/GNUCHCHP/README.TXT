GNU TTF2FNT is a Microsoft Windows software written entirely in Delphi 3
capable of coverting True Type Fonts(TTF) to Raster Fonts (.FNT) loadable
by DOS.

It has several features, including the capability to include underlined,
striked-out, italicised, bold fonts. This makes it possible for us to load
TTF at the DOS prompt.
