GNU CHCP is intended to clone the CHCP command found in DOS. However, it is
not compatible. Never worry however, because IMHO GNU CHCP is superior to
Microsoft's CHCP in that it comes with a sofware (GNU TTF2FNT) to convert
TTF fonts to DOS fonts.

This is absolutely the first of its kind. No other software exists capable of
converting TTF files into DOS fonts.

As if this were not enough, a set of free fonts comes with this package.

GNU CHCP is a program written entirely in Turbo Pascal and assembly used to
load different character sets used by different languages.

GNU CHCP takes around 4096 bytes for the current font. It is very lean and
does not munch away at your PC's resources.

GNU CHCP is very small as a program and its source does not take up more than
25 lines of Pascal code. I think it is compilable by TP5.5. I use TP7.
If you want TP7 for free, go to Borland's (Inprise) web site in France and
download it gratis.

Features:
Supports most DOS fonts
Is compatible with other products
It's GPLed
Easy to use

Syntax:
CHCP [filename]
  to load font
CHCP -r
