This is a port of GNU Sed 4.2.2 to MSDOS/DJGPP.

  This package contains the GNU implementation of sed, the Unix stream editor.



1.:     DJGPP specific changes.
        =======================

      - This version of the port will support the generation of 8+3 valid
        backup names for input file names if only SFN support is available.
        This concerns the '-i' option (in-place editing).
      - The port will open the input stream in binary mode.  This will allow to
        process files that contain embedded ^Z and lone ^M characters.
      - This version of the port no longer support the bootstrapping of sed.
      - You will need LFN support to configure and compile the source package.
        I have no plans to support SFN systems to build the sed binaries.
      - No support for DJGPP's own regex function.  They no longer do match the
        GNU regex ones.  Here some work needs to be done before DJGPP's
        functions will again be a one-to-one substitute of GNU regex.
      - The DJGPP 2.05 version of the port has been compiled using gcc510 and
        bnu225br2.  DJGPP 2.03 and DJGPP 2.04 are no longer supported.
      - This port provides no NLS support for the version compiled with djdev205.
        It has been configured with NLS support disabled by passing the no-nls
        flag as argument to config.bat.  If you prefer NLS support you will have
        to reconfigure the sources omitting the no-nls flag when calling config.bat.

        As usual, all djgpp specific files (config.bat, diffs, readme files,
        etc.) are located in the djgpp subdir.


2.:     Installing the binary package.
        ==============================

2.1.:   Copy the binary distribution into the top DJGPP installation directory
        and unzip it running *ONE* of the following commands:
          unzip32 sed422br2.zip      or
          djtarx sed422br2.zip       or
          pkunzip -d sed422br2.zip

2.2.:   If there is no entry for the sed info docs in your dir file, located
        info directory, create one running the command:
          install-info --info-dir=/dev/env/DJDIR/info /dev/env/DJDIR/info/sed.info

        For further information about GNU Sed please read the info docs and the NEWS file.


3.:     Building the binaries from sources.
        ===================================

3.1.:   Create a temporary directory and copy the source package into the
        directory.  If you download the source distribution from one of the
        DJGPP sites, just unzip it preserving the directory structure
        running *ONE* of the following commands:
          unzip32 sed422sr2.zip      or
          djtarx sed422sr2.zip       or
          pkunzip -d sed422sr2.zip

3.2.:   To build the binaries you will need the following binary packages:
          djdev205.zip (or a later but NOT a prior version)
          bsh205bbr3.zip (or a later but NOT a prior version)
          gccNNNb.zip, bnuNNNb.zip, makNNNb.zip, filNNNb.zip, shlNNNb.zip,
          txtNNNb.zip, txiNNNb.zip, grepNNNb.zip, sedNNNb.zip, mktmpNNb.zip
          and difNNNb.zip.

        If you want to configure and compile this packages with NLS support
        enabled you must install licvNNNb.zip, lunsNNNb.zip and gtxNNNNb.zip.

        If you want to run the check you will need also:
          difNNNb.zip and mktmpNNNb.zip

        NNN represents the latest version number of the binary packages.  All
        this packages can be found in the /v2gnu directory of any
        ftp.delorie.com mirror.
        You will need bsh205bbr3.zip or later and *NOT* a prior version or
        the build will fail.  The same applies to djdev205.zip.

3.3.:   The package has been configured for DJGPP 2.05.  There is a separate
        build directory under the top srcdir (aka sed-4.2.2).  To build
        the binaries cd into _build.205 directory.  If for some reason you want
        to reconfigure the package cd into the build directory and run the
        following commands:
          del config.cache
          make clean
          ..\djgpp\config ./..

        Please note that you *MUST* delete the config.cache file in the /djgpp
        directory or you will not really reconfigure the sources because the
        configuration informations will be read from the cache file instead
        of being newly computed.

        config.bat, among other things, will start the configure script passing
        to it a couple of arguments.  You can control these argument passing the
        following command line arguments to config.bat:
          nls or no-nls, default nls.  NLS support.
          cache or no-cache, default cache.
          dep or no-dep, default no-dep.  No dependency tracking.
        All other configure specific options are not set by config.bat so their
        values are left as they are.  If no arguments are passed to config.bat
        then the default values are used.


        To build the programs in a directory other than where the sources are,
        you must add the parameter that specifies the source directory,
        e.g:
          x:\src\gnu\sed-4.2.2\djgpp\config x:/src/gnu/sed-4.2.2

        Lets assume you want to build the binaries in a directory placed on a
        different drive (z:\build in this case) from where the sources are,
        then you will run the following commands:
          z:
          md \build
          cd \build
          x:\src\gnu\sed-4.2.2\djgpp\config x:/src/gnu/sed-4.2.2

        The order of the options and the srcdir option does not matter.  You
        *MUST* use forward slashes to specify the source directory.

        The batch file will set same environment variables, make MSDOS specific
        modifications to the Makefile.in's and supply all other needed options
        to the configure script.

3.4.:   To compile the package run from the directory where you have configured
        the sources the command:
          make

3.5.:   Now you can run the tests if you like. From the directory where you have
        configured the sources run the command:
          make check

        No one of the tests should fail.

3.6.:   To install the binary, info docs and man pages run the following command
        from the directory where you have configured the sources:
          make install

        This will install the products into your DJGPP installation tree given
        by the default prefix "/dev/env/DJDIR".  If you prefer to install them
        into some other directory you will have to set prefix to the appropriate
        value:
          make install prefix=z:/some/other/place
