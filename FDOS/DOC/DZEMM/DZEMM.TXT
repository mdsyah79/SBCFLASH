    To install the manager, copy the .SYS and .DLL files to a directory in
    your %PATH%, %SystemRoot%\system32 preferred. You need to edit the file
    CONFIG.NT in %SystemRoot%\system32 and add the line (change D: to your
    Windows drive): device=D:\windows\system32\dzemm.sys

    The CONFIG.NT file used for testing in XP:

	dos=high, umb
	device=D:\windows\system32\himem.sys
	device=D:\windows\system32\dzemm.sys
	files=40
