Mateusz's  Saucy  Editor  (MSEDIT)  is a  simple  editor  working in  the DOS
environment.  I decided to write it, because I had been using the Microsoft's
EDIT editor for years, without finding any free alternative. Of course, there
is plenty of  free DOS  editors out  there,  but no  one has  ever matched my
expectations (or  should I  say, my  taste).  I guess  that's because  I  had
already been "formatted" by the MS editor :-)
You will  probably notice  that MSEDIT is  very similar to  Microsoft's EDIT.
That's a pure coincidence,  and there is no connection at all between both of
them!

MSEDIT features also a FB mode (has to be invoked using the /fb switch). This
mode allows to compile and run FreeBASIC source code from within the editor.

I hope you will like MSEDIT as much as I do! ;-)
