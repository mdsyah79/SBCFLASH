How to add a file extension to START.DAT
----------------------------------------

Here's a really simple way to do this...and for the benefit of the slower
people I'm going to outline it step by step.  REMEMBER:  Keep the text you
type at the very left of the screen.

1. Open START.DAT with your favorite editor.

2. In brackets, type the file's extension.
     e.g. If you want to associate FOO.BAR, you're going to type [BAR]

3. Hit ENTER.

4. Type Program=(Whatever program you want to open all the .BAR files with)
     e.g. If I want to open all the BAR files with EDIT.COM, I'd type
          Program=Edit

5. Hit ENTER.

6. -OPTIONAL-  If you want to add a description, you can.  Just type
   Description=(Your description).  Therefore, if I am going to describe
   the .BAR extension, I'd type:
      Description=It's an imaginary file.  It doesn't exist.

Finished demonstration
----------------------

[BAR]
Program=Edit
Description=It's an imaginary file.  It doesn't exist.
