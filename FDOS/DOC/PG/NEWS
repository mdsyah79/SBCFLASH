(BAHCL) 11 Dec 2007 (PG 1.16)
   - Use a buffer to reduce physical disk access
   - Support Traditional Chinese
   - redefine filemark
   - over 1000 filemarks
   - 10 bookmarks
   - 10 search history

(BAHCL) 11 Apr 2007 (PG 1.15)
   Bug fix for @file to view files from other drives
   Assembly opcode for 8088 CPU

   Save viewed file with foreground/background color
     Pressing function key F8, the full path and filename being viewed,
     together with the color that is set is saved to C:\PG.PG.
     Its operation is just as @file introduced in version 1.14.
     This is the answer to users with different colour appetite.

   Load other language fonts
     Another plugin CPIFNT is introduced to allow user to change to
     a different language font for certain situations.

     The font size is limited to 16x8x256 only.
     Those font files mentioned here are actually from a FreeDOS
     multi-language project maintained by Aitor.
     CPIFNT is used to extract a set of font files from EGA?.CPI.
     CPIFNT is another program I created for DOS users covered by the
     GNU GPL 2. DOS user are welcomed to download it from Johnson's
     website. Please read CPIFNT.MAN to learn how to use it.

     Operation is simple, press F7 launch plugin CPIFNT to search a
     wanted code page font from the current directory or from C:\CPI
     a *.CPF name is displayed on the status line, press Enter to
     accept and return to PG, ESC to abort, other keys will display
     the next font name in a circular fashion. Caller program may get
     the selected code page from the memory 40:F0..FF
     Please note the filename of a font file is the code page number.



(BAHCL) 11 Apr 2006 (PG 1.14)
        - interactive batch mode -- @file
          @file is a file containing a list of files PG get to view,
          it is generated with the "DIR" command or created with any
          editor, e.g. "DIR c:\source\pg /b/s /a-d > file", then
          "PG @file" will view all the files in @file, with
          C-PgUp/C-PgDn to move back and forth.
        - Alt-F shows the content of @file, move mouse cursor to the path
          and press Alt-F directly loads the new file.
        - @file can be edited with any text editor.
        - any invalid filename within @file will cause PG to abort.
        - @file is not mixed with other command line arguments.
        - F9,F10 are disabled with @file.
        - Alt-E toggles VGA 25/28/50 lines
        - cursor moved to a found string with auto panning feature.
        - top status line shows the mouse rests at a column;
        - turn mouse user subroutine off/on when shell out to DOS.
        - plugins enhanced/bug fixed.
          svtxt keeps a long wrapped word together in the next line;
          a bug fixed in svhex as counter overrun;
          both svhex and svtxt handle regular/piped file with no limits.

   @file -- response file
     a list of file PG get to view generated with the "DIR" command
       e.g. "DIR c:\source\*.c /b/s /a-d > file"
       then "PG @file" and navigate the files with C-PgUp/C-PgDn;
     F9,F10 disabled with @file, to choose a new file, press Alt-f to
       displays @file, move mouse pointer over a path, Alt-f loads a new file;
     @file does not work with other arguments;
   Cursor moves to a string found with search
   Information in top/bottom status line relocated:
     " PG --" removed; screen line number and total line number swapped location
     "<top>" / "<end>" replace screen line number at BOF / EOF
   Search result in bottom status line removed;
   Show mouse cursor x-coord. in top status line;
   Handle mouse user subroutine while shell out to DOS;
   Alt-e changes VGA display to 25/28/50 lines
   SVTXT
     keep long wrapped word together in next line;
     support unlimited file size;
   SVHEX
     bug fixed as a counter overruns;
     support unlimited file size;


(BAHCL) 10 Sep 2005 (PG 1.13)
   Mouse aids to begin a search
     place the mouse pointer over the word and press F4,
     the word is stuffed into the search string, the search
     string is 18 bytes only.
     Note the mouse driver does not synchonize actual mouse pointer
     without a move.
   Input new path to read additional files
     Press Alt-f to input a new file specification, note the
     DOS conventional filename restriction rule. No long file name.
   Add 5 filemarks for recall
     the path of a file being viewed can be saved and later recalled
     as user inputs new paths for additional files, key 6..0 under the
     function keys stores the full path and topline as filemark,
     Alt-6..0 recall the files saved and topline restored as well.
     PG preassigns the first file to all filemarks.
   Command line arguments
     PG supports multiple command line arguments. Each argument is
     a set of files can be access with F9 / F10 which corresponds
     to proceeding and following set, page up / down will access all
     files in a sequential fashion. The files input from Alt-F always
     be the last set of files, and only one set of files allowed.
     Invalid argument triggers error message.
   Show column, line number at the bottom status line if search is OK
   Plugin handles polluted IACA
     Plugin receives parameters from IACA, if it is polluted,
     the requested starting position > file size, that caused
     plugin, when started as standalone, to abort.
     In such cases, plugins will start from BOF instead.

(BAHCL) 1 Nov 2003 (PG 1.03)
   Search text from infile back and forth;
   Move most asm subroutine to pgasm.asm;
   This is the final version for DDS C compiler;
   After version 1.03, PG will be migrated to Borland Turbo C 2.01
   for these reasons:
   1. conform to ANSI C standard
   2. long integer support
   3. better programming environment for development
   4. easier to debug (not so true!)
   5. extracted assembly subroutines may be usable by other programs
   6. I failed to compile PG with an earlier version of Micro-C.
      The version of DDS Micro-C version 3.22 I once downloaded
      disappears in the internet, I doubt if Dave Dunfield has
      stopped offering version 3.22 as a freeware.

   So, after version 1.03, I'll stop using Micro-C to maintain PG.

   Move global #define statements to pg.h
   Convert #defined constants to upper case

Messages from previous PG maintainer(s):
============================================================
I have made a few changes to the source, but didn't (technically)
delete anything.  I removed the verbose GNU License statement in the
usage() function.  To put it back in, add this to the code:

   #define SHOW_GNU_COPYING

or, compile like this:

  cc pg.c -fop SHOW_GNU_COPYING=1

============================================================
I have set the default behavior of the program to operate in
mono-mode only.  This is a color scheme that should work well on all
monitors, even a mono display.  To build using Bill's original
colors, add this to the code:

   #define USE_COLOR_MODE

or, compile like this:

  cc pg.c -fop USE_COLOR_MODE=1



============================================================

(jh) 25 Aug 1998 (PG 1.0)
   Cleaned up the code so constants, structs, typedefs, .. are
   grouped together.  Also cleaned up comment style.

(jh) 24 Aug 1998 (PG 0.96)
   Updated the C++ comments so they are C comments now.  Still to do:
   clean up the indenting, release as 1.0

(wew) 21 Aug 1998 (PG 0.95)
   add tab processing. 8 chars for now.
   updated my email address in the code

(jh) 18 Aug 1998 (PG 0.94)
   set the default colors to be in mono mode, which is guaranteed to
   work on all monitors, even mono displays.

(jh) 18 Aug 1998 (PG 0.93)
   set RETURN to scroll down one line, SPACE to scroll down one page,
   and 'Q' and 'q' to quit.  These are all extensions.

(jh) 17 Aug 1998 (PG 0.92)
   started doing code cleanup, and put usage text in usage() function,
   instead of leaving the text split from the function.
   Also, moved the revision notes to this 'NEWS' file.

BH 95.04.19  Fixed small bug in clreol
BH 95.04.18  Added scroll_[up & down] & clreol to get rid of flickering
BH 95.04.04  Read in whole file of line addrs first
