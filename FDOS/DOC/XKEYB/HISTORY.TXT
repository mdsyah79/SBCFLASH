Aitor SANTAMAR÷A MERINO - FreeDOS XKEYB
=========================================


        VER 1.5.1  xKEYB 1.5 was packed WITHOUT .key files
      (24.9.2000)  1.5.1 is just 1.5 with all the .key files packed

        VER 1.6    * Search on PATH capability (Ralf Quint)
      (27.1.2001)  * Changes to .KEY files (Aitor):
                     - DVORAK.KEY (Eugene Wong)
                     - SU.KEY to RU.KEY
                     - Bug 126 fixed (small patch to IT.KEY)

        VER 1.7    *  LED support removed (Aitor, Axel)
      (12.9.2001)  *  Improved search of .key files (also in curdir)
                      (Aitor, Ralf)
                   * Added XKEYB.FHL, the fast help, and it is
                     shown with /? (Aitor)
                   * New Copyright notice (Aitor)
                   * XKEYBRES is now included within this file using DEFINEs
                     this way, changes are reflected in both codes (Aitor)
                   * Switched the reported values in BX/CX for int2Fh/AX=AD80h
                     for MS compatibility (Aitor)
			 * New Makefile (Axel, Ralf, Aitor)
			 * Most of the messages are now displayed in English (Ralf)
			 * Added br850.key (for Brazil, codepage 850) (Alain)
        VER 1.8    * Scancodes now up to 127 (Aitor)
      (31.12.2001) * Solved the problem with the two keys having same Scancode:
                     the (/ ? key) and the (Gray /) key, that causes troubles in
                     non-US keyboards) (Aitor)
                     (thanks to Eric Auer for his hints!)
                   * The Extended E0-keys (Ins, Supr, arrows...) do NOT behave
                     as their normal-AT conunterparts with SHIFT (Aitor)
                   * Translation of source comments into English
                     (Michael Kallas, MANY, MANY thanks!)
                   * Fixes in SCANKBD to patch it during MAKE process (Aitor)
                   * SCANKBD is now more friendly on parameters (Aitor)
                   * CONTRIBUTED LAYOUTS:
                       PC860   JosÇ A. Senna
                     MODIFIED/UPDATED LAYOUTS:
                       ALL     Added support for extended53 key (gray /)
                       BR850   Alain (modifies COMBI)
                       PC850   Alain, Aitor (Adds COMBI)
                       SP(850) Luis Ignacio Estrada Hoyos, Jose Antonio (jafras)
                       LA(850) Luis Ignacio Estrada Hoyos
                          (in SP and LA: added COMBIs and some useful stuff:
                           tilde in AltGr+•)
                     REMOVED LAYOUTS:
                       PC8 (Standard US-437, incomplete and normally unnccessary)
                       RU  (it was equal to SU, whence incorrect)
                       ECMA94  (combis only, does NOT work!)
        VER 1.9    * Alt+9 bug fixed!
      (04.04.2002)  Problem was: Alt+9 produces virtualscancode 128, which was
                     interpretated by StoreKey as a request for XString
                     Solved using the dirty trick of a new variable Alt+9
                   * Allowed immediate comments in lines which very first
                     character is ';' (I hope there are no combis with this character!)
                   * Now returns control to next in chain for non-defined functions:
                     83..8F, 92, 93 and 9D..FF
                   * All layouts include now support for [INS 0] key
                     (thanks to Imre Leber)
                   * MODIFIED/UPDATED LAYOUTS:
                     - PC860   Jose A. Senna
                     - BE      Pierre (now contains COMBIs!)
                     CONTRIBUTED LAYOUTS
                     - US-LV   Kristaps Kaupe
                     - RU      Kristaps Kaupe
                     - HU      Nagy Zsolt
                     - PL      Michal H. Tyc
                     - TR      <sz_chake@hotmail.com>
        VER 1.10   * E0 keys support completed.
      (14.4.2002)    ScanKbd and .KEY files patched accordingly
                     Advantages:
                     - Ctrl+Alt+Del bug fixed
                     - Support for Win keys and multimedia keys (read the docs)
                     Disadvantage:
                     - Over 800b more resident memory! :-(
                   * Before going resident, environment memory is freed
                   * Before resetting, disk caches are flushed
                     (Thanks to: Matthias Paul, Axel for the code for this,
                                 imported from his FreeKEYB)
        VER 1.11   * New hardcoded XFunctions. Default XFunction table:
       (8.5.2002)    247: INT 19h (closes OS/2 DOS Box)
                     250: Disables XKEYB
                     251: Suspends PC (required APM 1.1 or later) (new!)
                     252: Turns the PC Off (required APM 1.1 or later) (new!)
                     253: Performs a cold reboot (new!)
                     254: INT 5h (Print Screen)
                     255: Performs a warm reboot
                   * User defined xfunctions now up to 34 (was up to 39)
                   * New way of defining COMBIs: no longer based in ASCII,
                     but use !C1, !C2,... to assign key combination to
                     the first, second, ... row in [COMBI] section
                     (fixes the problem with ' character in some layouts)
                   * TRUE support of E0-extended keys, fixing all problems
                     that appeared with numeric keys in various editors
                   * New switch /E, to ignore the E0-prefix, and preassign
                     extended keys to their non-extended counterpart
                     (warning, switch not to be used with multimedia keys,
                     winkeys, etc)
        VER 1.12   * Ctrl^CursorUp Ctrl^Cursor down generate correct scancode
       (8.6.2002)    (thanks Axel for noticing)
                   * Fixed scancode for AltGr+number key
                   * Fixed scancode with COMBIs (should be 0!)
                   * Fixed potential problem with Ctrl+Alt+F2 and XKEYBRES if
                     file was not loaded (now with FileLoaded variable)
                   * Fixed problem with character ASCII $E0
                   * 286 and AT is now checked at the begining
                   * All the KEY files have now the "Ctrl+Alt+F1 disable"
                     behaviour by default (modification on the KEY files)
                   * Updated keyboard layout: PC850
                   * Added keyboard layout:   ECMA23 (probably buggy), BR275
        VER 1.13   * In case of Error, DOSExitCode is set to an error code
      (27.7.2002)  * New layout: PC437.KEY
                   * PC437.KEY is ALWAYS read before any other, so KEY files
                     just need to have the differences
                   * Corrected: if Ctrl+^vInsDel is not assigned anything,
                     then it behaves like BIOS (does NOTHING)
                   * Fixed possibly weird behaviour of Alt+ keys affected by
                     NumLock different from keypad
                   * Completely new debugged header for int9handler
                     (includes input buffer checking and timeout)
                     Also the proto-int15h has been almost completely rewritten
                     Fixes a potential bug with GetKey and XFunctions
                   * StoreKey now forks into EfStoreKey, the procedure that
                     really gets key into buffer; StoreKey simply parses any
                     possible ASCII,Scancode to its corresponding action.
                   * Xfunction 249: Break interrupt (for ctrl+break)
                   * Changes of virtual ScanCode moved into StoreKey
                   * API function 94h: AH=BH=ScanCode, no longer separation
                     between real and virtual scancode
                   * Removed /E option to map E0-extended into non-extended
                     (for commandline compatibility reasons)
                   * When overloading install, if config file is not found,
                     action is aborted
                   * E0-prefix is now tracked through BIOS variable
                     0040h:0096h (KeysDown2)
                   * Alt+NumberPad and Pause behave now the same as BIOS Keyb
                   * F11 and F12 scancodes are now patched
                   * New policy for testing keyStatus bits: now better
                     behaviour with pressing multiple shifting keys
                   * PrtScrt recovered in the KEY files
                   * Added:  JP106 (Japanese, Takeshi Hamasaki)
                     Reworked: PC850 and BR275 (Henrique Peron),
                               FR (Patrice LEMONNIER)
                     Patched:  all, so that there's response to PrtScr
        VER 1.14   * New unified scancode translation procedure. Fixes
      (28.10.2002)   several bugs:
                     - Ctrl+INS, Ctrl+DEL (and Ctrl+other cursors)
                     - Shift+F4 and Shift+F5
                   * Minor fix in Alt+Numberpad codes
                   * Minor optimization: with XString no need to store $FF as
                     ASCII
                   * Patch for ASCII character F0h
                   * Better organization of the package
                   * Includes the "Reduced Layout Packs v.1.0 by Henrique Peron

        VER 1.15   * Patched the translate scancode routine for F11 and F12 keys,
      (11.04.2003)   (they returned the appropriate value -1)
