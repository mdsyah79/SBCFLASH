Name:Adefine-abbrev
Defines an abbreviation for the string before the point.  This is extremely
simple, and uses up Mint string space for the abbreviations.  For my uses
these sorts of abbreviations are far superior to the "dabbrev" ones that are
also around --- but I do tend to produce some fairly obscure documents!
Arg1 is the mode to define the abbrev in (if any).
[*]
