------------------
XDEL was introduced by DR-DOS and a long time later M$ introduced deltree.
 This implementation of XDEL is intended to be 100% compatible with
 DR-DOS version. If you find anything different, consider it a bug
 and send me a notofication, please.

XDEL can be used in place of deltree, but in fact it has more options, including:
- default is not to delete Read/Only files,
- option to include _or_not_ subdirectories
- option to wipe all files before deleting.
- options to ask or not for confirmation, individualy or globaly

example:
    XDEL  /RY  *.*
will remove all files, including R/O and it will NOT ask for confirmation :)

It has one major difference:
    XDEL /SRDN DIR\*.*
will delete all files and subdirectories just as
    DELTREE /Y DIR\*.*
but the directory DIR\  will NOT be removed (This is the DR-DOS standard)

------------------
Usage
XDEL [/options] [@][d:][path]filename[.ext]... [/options]

  @             the following filename is the name of a file list
  d:            drive which xdel is to search
  path          directory where search is to begin
  filename.ext  file to be deleted (wildcards allowed)
  /D            remove empty subdirectories
  /N or /Y      delete specified files with no warning (CAREFUL!)
  /O            overwrite before deleting - file contents PERMANENTLY LOST
  /P            prompt before deleting each file
  /R            delete read-only files
  /S            delete files in subdirectories
  /H or /?      this help message

Multiple files may be specified on the command line.

------------------
On Exit it sets Error Level:
    1 = syntax error
    2 = could not delete (for any reason, including operator cancel)
    3 = out of memory
