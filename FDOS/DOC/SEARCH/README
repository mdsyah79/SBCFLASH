Overview
--------
  This searches for files on your computer, tells you where they are, and
  how many total.  This was one of the first programs I wrote in C.

Source code
-----------
  The source code is available under the terms of the GNU General Public
  License (copying.txt).  If you want to use it in your programs, the
  program you are writing must be released under the GNU GPL as well.  No
  royalties are expected, although donations are always accepted :-).

  The source was compiled with Borland Turbo C++ 3.0.  If you want to compile
  the sources with other compilers, you may have to tweak a couple of files
  to get it to work.
