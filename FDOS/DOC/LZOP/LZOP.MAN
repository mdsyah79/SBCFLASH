       llllzzzzoooopppp reduces the size of the named files. Whenever
       possible, each file is compressed into one with the
       extension ....llllzzzzoooo, while keeping the same ownership modes,
       access and modification times. If no files are specified,
       or if a file name is "-", lzop tries to compress the
       standard input to the standard output. lzop will only
       attempt to compress regular files. In particular, it will
       ignore directories and symbolic links.

       If the compressed file name is too long for its file
       system, llllzzzzoooopppp truncates it.

       By default, llllzzzzoooopppp keeps the original file name and
       timestamp in the compressed file. These are used when
       decompressing the file with the ----NNNN option. This is useful
       when the compressed file name was truncated or when the
       time stamp was not preserved after a file transfer.

       Compressed files can be restored to their original form
       using llllzzzzoooopppp ----dddd. If the original name saved in the
       compressed file is not suitable for its file system, a new
       name is constructed from the original one to make it
       legal.

       llllzzzzoooopppp ----dddd takes a list of files on its command line and
       decompresses each file whose name ends with ....llllzzzzoooo and which
       begins with the correct magic number to an uncompressed
       file without the original extension. llllzzzzoooopppp ----dddd also
       recognizes the special extension ....ttttzzzzoooo as shorthand for
       ....ttttaaaarrrr....llllzzzzoooo.  When compressing, lzop uses the ....ttttzzzzoooo extension
       if necessary instead of truncating a file with a ....ttttaaaarrrr
       extension.

       llllzzzzoooopppp uses the _L_Z_O _d_a_t_a _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n _l_i_b_r_a_r_y for compression
       services. The amount of compression obtained depends on
       the size of the input and the distribution of common
       substrings.  Typically, text such as source code or
       English is compressed into 40-50% of the original size,
       and large files usually compress much better than small
       ones. Compression and decompression speed is generally

       much faster than that achieved by ggggzzzziiiipppp, but compression
       ratio is worse.

       llllzzzzoooopppp preserves the mode, ownership and timestamps of files
       when compressing or decompressing.

       llllzzzzoooopppp always keeps original files unchanged unless you use
       the option ----UUUU.

       lzop offers the following compression levels of the LZO1X
       algorithm:

       -3  the default level offers pretty fast compression.
           Note that -2, -3, -4, -5 and -6 are currently all
           equivalent - this may change in a future release.

       -1, --fast
           can be even a little bit faster in some cases - but
           most times you won't notice the difference

       -7, -8, -9, --best
           these compression levels are mainly intended for
           generating pre-compressed data - especially ----9999 can be
           somewhat slow

       Decompression is _v_e_r_y fast for all compression levels.

       If no other command is given then lzop defaults to
       compression.

       -#, --fast, --best
           Regulate the speed of compression using the specified
           digit ####, where -1 or --fast indicates the fastest
           compression method (less compression) and -9 or --best
           indicates the slowest compression method (best
           compression). The default compression level is -3.

       -d, --decompress, --uncompress
           Decompress. Each file will be placed into same the
           directory as the compressed file.

       -x, --extract
           Extract compressed files to the current working
           directory. This is the same as `-dNp'.

       -t, --test
           Test. Check the compressed file integrity.

       -l, --list
           For each compressed file, list the following fields:

             compressed: size of the compressed file

             ratio: compression ratio
             uncompressed_name: name of the uncompressed file

           In combination with the --verbose option, the
           following fields are also displayed:

             date & time: time stamp for the uncompressed file

           With --name, the uncompressed name, date and time are
           those stored within the compress file if present.

           With --verbose, the size totals and compression ratio
           for all files is also displayed. With --quiet, the
           title and totals lines are not displayed.

           Note that lzop defines compression ratio as
           compressed_size / uncompressed_size.

       --info
           For each compressed file, list the internal header
           fields.

       -I, --sysinfo
           Display information about the system and quit.

       -L, --license
           Display the lzop license and quit.

       -h, -H, --help
           Display a help screen and quit.

       -V  Version. Display the version number and compilation
           options then quit.

       --version
           Version. Display the version number then quit.

       Note that ----tttt has priority over ----dddd, ----llll over ----tttt, and so on.

OOOOPPPPTTTTIIIIOOOONNNNSSSS
       -c, --stdout, --to-stdout
           Write output on standard output. If there are several
           input files, the output consists of a sequence of
           independently (de)compressed members. To obtain better
           compression, concatenate all input files before
           compressing them.

       -o _F_I_L_E, --output=_F_I_L_E
           Write output to the file _F_I_L_E. If there are several
           input files, the output consists of a sequence of
           independently (de)compressed members.



1998-03-13                  lzop 0.96                           3





LZOP(1)                                                   LZOP(1)


       -p, -p_D_I_R, --path=_D_I_R
           Write output files into the directory _D_I_R instead of
           the directory determined by the input file. If _D_I_R is
           omitted, then write to the current working directory.

       -f, --force
           Force lzop to

            - overwrite existing files
            - compress from stdin even if it seems a terminal
            - compress to stdout even if it seems a terminal
            - allow option -c in combination with -U

           Using ----ffff two ore more times forces things like

            - compress files that already have a .lzo suffix
            - decompress files that do not have a valid suffix
            - try to handle compressed files with unknown header flags

           Use with care.

       -F, --no-checksum
           Do not store or verify a checksum of the uncompressed
           file when compressing or decompressing.  This speeds
           up the operation of lzop a little bit, but as
           unnoticed data corruption can happen in case of
           damaged compressed files the usage of this option is
           not generally recommended.

       -n, --no-name
           When decompressing, do not restore the original file
           name if present (remove only the lzop suffix from the
           compressed file name). This option is the default
           under UNIX.

       -N, --name
           When decompressing, restore the original file name if
           present. This option is useful on systems which have a
           limit on file name length.  This is the default under
           DOS, Windows and OS/2.

       -S _._s_u_f, --suffix=_._s_u_f
           Use suffix _._s_u_f instead of _._l_z_o. The suffix must not
           contain multiple dots and special characters like '+'
           or '*', and suffixes other than _._l_z_o should be avoided
           to avoid confusion when files are transferred to other
           systems.

       -k, --keep
           Do not delete input files. This is the default.

       -U, --unlink, --delete
           Delete input files after succesfull compression or
           decompression. Beware. Use this option to make lzop

           behave like ggggzzzziiiipppp. Note that ----kkkk overrides ----UUUU.

       --no-stdin
           Do not try to read standard input. This option is
           necessary in cron jobs (which do not have a
           controlling terminal).  A file name "-" will still
           override this option.

       -q, --quiet, --silent
           Suppress all warnings.

       -v, --verbose
           Verbose. Display the name for each file compressed or
           decompressed. Multiple ----vvvv can be used to increase the
           verbosity of some commands.

       --no-color
           Do not use any color escape sequences.

       --mono
           Assume a mono ANSI terminal. This is the default under
           UNIX.

       --color
           Assume a color ANSI terminal or try full-screen
           access. This is the default under DOS and in a Linux
           virtual console.

       --intro
           Try to display that nice intro sequence then quit.
           Needs full-screen access.

       --filter=_N_U_M_B_E_R
           Rarely useful.  Preprocess data with a special
           "multimedia" filter before compressing in order to
           improve compression ratio.  _N_U_M_B_E_R must be a decimal
           number from 1 to 16, inclusive.  Using a filter slows
           down both compression and decompression quite a bit,
           and the compression ratio usually doesn't improve much
           either...  More effective filters may be added in the
           future, though.

           You can try --filter=1 with data like 8-bit sound
           samples, --filter=2 with 16-bit samples or depth-16
           images, etc.

           Un-filtering during decompression is handled
           automatically.

       -C, --checksum
           Deprecated. Only for compatibility with old versions
           as lzop now uses a checksum by default.

       If you wish to create a single archive file with multiple
       members so that members can later be extracted
       independently, you should prefer a full-featured archiver
       such as tar or zip. The latest version of GNU tar supports
       the --------uuuusssseeee----ccccoooommmmpppprrrreeeessssssss----pppprrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm====llllzzzzoooopppp option to invoke lzop
       transparently.  lzop is designed as a complement to tar,
       not as a replacement.

       The environment variable LLLLZZZZOOOOPPPP can hold a set of default
       options for lzop. These options are interpreted first and
       can be overwritten by explicit command line parameters.
       For example:

           for sh/ksh/zsh:    LZOP="-1v --name"; export LZOP
           for csh/tcsh:      setenv LZOP "-1v --name"
           for DOS:           set LZOP=-1v --name

       On Vax/VMS, the name of the environment variable is
       LZOP_OPT, to avoid a conflict with the symbol set for
       invocation of the program.

       Note that not all options are valid in the environment
       variable - lzop will tell you.
