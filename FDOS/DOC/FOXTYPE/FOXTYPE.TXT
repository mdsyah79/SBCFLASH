             ------------------------------------------------------

 FoxType is an open-source program similar to the DOSish 'TYPE' command. The
 main  differences are  that FoxType  works in graphic  mode (so it does not
 allow redirection nor piping) and it's able to display UTF-8 text files.
 In fact, I wrote FoxType because I needed a simple DOS program, which would
 allow me to view multilanguage text files in DOS.

 FoxType is a 32 bits application, so it requires at least a 80386 processor
 with a VGA graphic card.

 The Unicode support isn't complete yet. I am still adding new characters to
 the database, as I want to make it fully compliant with Unicode 3.0.
 Actually, unsupported characters are displayed as red '?' marks.

 USAGE: FOXTYPE file.txt [/1280]

 The /1280 parameter  switches FoxType to  1280x1024 video  mode (requires a
 VESA 1.2  compatible  graphic  card). In that  mode FoxType  supports  more
 Unicode characters, for example some asian scripts which are too complex to
 be displayed  at 640x480 resolution,  other glyphs are simply smoother.  If
 you would like FoxType used that video mode by default,  you should specify
 a DOS environment variable 'FOXTYPE = /1280'.  To do that, just type in the
 DOS prompt 'SET FOXTYPE=/1280'.

 WARNING: Before using the 1280x1024 VESA graphic mode, please check in your
          computer's documentation if your monitor can handle it! There is a
          risk that  such high  resolution could damage some  old-generation
          monitors (usualy those made before 1998 are the most vulnerable).

 If you  have any  comments  or suggestions, or if  you would  like I add a
 specific character to the database in priority, feel free to mail me!
