     WHAT IS SLOWINT1?
     อออออออออออออออออ

     SLOWINT1 is a DOS TSR (Terminate-but-Stay Resident) program that will
     Slow your computer Down.  The method it uses to Slow the computer Down
     is quite unique, and requires some explanation.

     You may also be wondering why the heck anyone would ever want to make
     their computer run slower than it already does.  Read on, and I'll try
     to explain it all to you.  Let's start by briefly discussing why you may
     want to Slow your computer Down.

     There are two main reasons you may want the computer to run more slowly
     than it normally does.  The first reason is if you are trying to run an
     old program, designed for an old computer, and it doesn't work correctly
     on a new, fast computer.  The old program could either "blow up" on a
     fast computer, or could run in such a way that it is impossible to use.

     The second reason you may want the computer to run slowly is as a
     troubleshooting tool.  Sometimes, when you're trying to troubleshoot
     another program, the error or status messages flash by so fast on the
     screen that you can't figure out what's going on.  With the computer
     running slowly, you may be able to see what the messages say before they
     have a chance to disappear off the screen again.


     Now that we've talked about why you may want to use SLOWINT1, let's talk
     about how it works.  All CPU's have a special "mode" they can operate
     in, called "Trace Mode" or "Debug Mode" or "Single-Step Mode".  The main
     purpose for this special Mode is so that you can run a particular
     program "underneath" another special program called a Debugger.  The
     Debugger lets you Single-Step through the other program as it is
     running, temporarily stopping in between each CPU instruction.  This
     lets you see exactly what the program is doing, step by step, in
     minuscule detail.  That way, you can figure out exactly where problems
     (bugs) are happening so that you can fix (debug) them.  Programmers use
     Debuggers all the time.

     While the main reason for Trace Mode is to Debug programs, it turns out
     that you can use Trace Mode to do other things also.  SLOWINT1 is able
     to use Trace Mode to make the computer run MUCH more slowly than it
     normally does.  When the CPU is in Trace Mode, the CPU runs a special
     "program" in between each "regular" CPU instruction.  The Special
     "program" associated with Trace Mode is called Interrupt 1 (hence the
     name SLOWINT1).








                       SLOWINT1 1.00            Page 2 of 15



     When SLOWINT1 is installed into memory and ENABLEd, it will put the CPU
     into Trace Mode, and run a special "slowdown program" for Interrupt 1. 
     Because the special "program" is performed between each CPU instruction,
     in effect, each "regular" CPU instruction is turned into several CPU
     instructions.  The extra Trace Mode CPU instructions really don't do
     anything useful (they just slow things down).


     There are a couple of things you need to know about using SLOWINT1,
     though.  First of all, SLOWINT1 will slow down the computer A LOT.  The
     computer will usually run at less than 2% of normal speed.  There are
     not too many circumstances where you will actually want your computer to
     run that slowly, but there are some.

     The other thing you need to know about Trace Mode is that it is
     EXTREMELY INcompatible with certain computers and programs.  It has so
     many compatibility issues, in fact, that you need to be VERY careful
     about using it (and may not even want to use it at all).  If that didn't
     scare you off already, please keep reading.  SLOWINT1 does have a
     legitimate purpose, though you may have a hard time figuring out what
     possible use such a "bad" program could have.  Let's talk specifically
     about the compatibility problems you can have.


     The first major compatibility problem with SLOWINT1 is your computers
     clock.  While in Trace Mode, your computers clock may lose time.  I
     don't understand how or why it does this (it shouldn't), but sometimes
     it happens anyway.  So, if you use SLOWINT1, and you want your computers
     Date and Time to be correct, you may constantly need to be setting the
     correct Date and Time.  Someday, I may figure out why this is happening
     and fix it.  Until then, you may need to keep updating your clock.

     The second major compatibility issue with SLOWINT1 is Microsoft Windows. 
     Simply put, Windows HATES Trace Mode.  If you are running in a DOS Box
     underneath Windows, and try to run SLOWINT1, Windows will instantly
     crash.  Sometimes it will crash the entire Windows Operating
     Environment, and sometimes it will just crash the DOS Box you were
     trying to turn on Trace Mode from.  Bottom line is that you can't use
     SLOWINT1 underneath Windows.  SLOWINT1 does not check to see if Windows
     is loaded or not when you run it, and therefore probably will crash the
     computer if you try to use SLOWINT1 and Windows at the same time.












                       SLOWINT1 1.00            Page 3 of 15



     On one particular computer I've tested, Windows is EXTREMELY
     incompatible with Trace Mode.  Trace mode doesn't even need to be turned
     on when Windows is running for the computer to crash.  All you need to
     do is put the CPU into Trace Mode before Windows starts (even if just
     momentarily), and Windows instantly crashes.  The specific computer that
     crashes on me is a Dell Laptop.  I have a Dell Desktop that was made
     about the same time as the Dell Laptop, and it works fine, so it's not a
     problem with all Dells.  The Dell Laptop is the only Laptop I've tested
     it on, so it's possible (though EXTREMELY unlikely) that the problem
     occurs on all (or at least many) Laptops.  It's also possible that my
     particular Dell Laptop is the only one with a problem (though I doubt
     that, also).  I just don't know.

     In summary, don't try to run SLOWINT1 around Microsoft Windows unless
     you are REALLY sure you know what you're doing, and you have a very
     good, specific reason to do it.


     Now that I've got you all worked up about those potential problems, let
     me tell you what SLOWINT1 is for.  As stated, about the only useful
     thing SLOWINT1 really does is Slow Down your computer.  I don't
     recommend that you use SLOWINT1 to Slow Down your computer, however.  I
     have another program, called SLOWDOWN, which is what you should use
     instead.  SLOWDOWN is MUCH more sophisticated and MUCH more
     comprehensive than SLOWINT1.  SLOWDOWN gives you almost complete control
     over how exactly fast your computer runs.  The ability to put the CPU
     into Trace Mode is built into both SLOWDOWN and SLOWINT1.  SLOWDOWN
     switches the CPU in and out of Trace Mode automatically, when it is
     appropriate, based on exactly how fast you want the computer to run.

     The main reason for making a separate SLOWINT1 program is so that you
     can experiment with Trace Mode (independently from SLOWDOWN) to see
     exactly what Trace Mode is and how it affects your computer.  You can
     use SLOWINT1 to Slow Down the computer if you really want to, but
     SLOWDOWN will typically do a MUCH better job for you.  The reason that
     SLOWINT1 even exists is so that you can "isolate" and experiment with
     Trace Mode to see exactly if and when you may want SLOWDOWN to use it.

     In fact, if you've managed to get a copy of SLOWINT1 and didn't get a
     copy of SLOWDOWN at the same time, then something is wrong (they are
     supposed to be distributed together).  If you don't have a copy of
     SLOWDOWN, go to my web site and download the latest version.  The URL of
     my web site is detailed in the "WARRANTY" section below (page 14).

     HOW TO USE SLOWINT1
     อออออออออออออออออออ

     SLOWINT1 is relatively small, simple TSR (Terminate-but-Stay-Resident)
     program.  When it is installed in memory, it uses less than 1K (1000
     bytes) of memory.  That's not very much memory, so you can leave
     SLOWINT1 in memory all of the time and just ENABLE it (turn it On) or
     DISABLE it (turn it Off) at the appropriate times.  You can also
     UNINSTALL it from memory completely if you want.  UNINSTALLing it will
     free up a small amount of memory for your other programs to use.

     You tell SLOWINT1 exactly what you want it to do with command-line
     Options.  Each command-line Option has several different "formats" it
     can be in.  For example, to ENABLE SLOWINT1 (to have your computer start
     running Slowly), you could do any of these things:

       SLOWINT1 E
       SLOWINT1 Enable
       SLOWINT1 On

     The shorter Options (like "E") are faster and easier to type, but the
     longer ones (like "Enable") are more descriptive and are easier to
     understand as you're reading them.  You can use whichever one you want.

     The Options are not case sensitive ("SLOWINT1 E" is the same as
     "SLOWINT1 e", etc.).  The Options can be entered in any order.  If you
     enter two different Options that conflict with each other, the last one
     entered will take precedence.  For example:

       SLOWINT1 Disable Enable

     will simply attempt to ENABLE Trace Mode, just like you had never even
     entered the "Disable".  Here are the different command-line Options and
     what they do:



















                       SLOWINT1 1.00            Page 5 of 15



     * E  Enable  On

       This ENABLEs Trace Mode (which will cause the computer to start
       running Slowly).  This is also the Default setting, which means that
       if you simply enter a "SLOWINT1" line (with no Options at all),
       SLOWINT1 will act as if you entered "SLOWINT1 Enable".  That is,
       SLOWINT1 will install itself into memory as a TSR and start Slowing
       the computer Down.  If you want to install SLOWINT1 into memory
       without Slowing the computer Down right away, you will need to use the
       DISABLE Option (directly below).


     * D  Disable Off

       This DISABLEs Trace Mode (which will cause the computer to start
       running at regular speed again).  If you simply want to install
       SLOWINT1 into memory, but do not want it to Slow Down the computer,
       you MUST use the DISABLE Option when you install it.  For example, you
       could put a line similar to the following in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

         SLOWINT1 Disable

       This will install SLOWINT1 into memory, but it will immediately be
       DISABLEd.  Later on, when you actually want SLOWINT1 to do something,
       you can use the ENABLE Option (directly above) to turn it on.


     * U  Uninstall  Out  Remove

       This will UNINSTALL (or at least attempt to UNINSTALL) SLOWINT1 from
       memory.  Effectively, you can do the same thing (have the computer run
       at normal speed again) with the DISABLE Option (directly above).  If
       SLOWINT1 is successfully UNINSTALLed from memory, it will free up a
       small amount of memory for other programs to use.



















                       SLOWINT1 1.00            Page 6 of 15



     * V  Verbose  Talk

     * Q  Quiet  ShutUp

       There are two different Options described here (VERBOSE and QUIET). 
       They are actually complements (opposites) of each other, but I am
       going to discuss them at the same time.  By default, when you do
       anything with SLOWINT1 from the command-line, SLOWINT1 is VERBOSE. 
       That is, it will display on the screen the Status of what it is doing
       (for instance, telling you whether it is ENABLEd or not).  You may not
       want SLOWINT1 to keep cluttering up your screen with stuff like this
       that you don't care to see.  If so, you can tell SLOWINT1 to be QUIET. 
       For example:

         SLOWINT1 Quiet Enable

       will ENABLE SLOWINT1 (turn it On), but it won't actually tell you that
       your computer is running Slowly (not that you couldn't figure that out
       pretty quickly all by yourself anyway).

       Note that SLOWINT1 will always display error messages on the screen,
       even if the QUIET Option is set.  The QUIET Option only prevents
       configuration information from being displayed, not error information.


     * H  Help  ?

       This will display a HELP screen detailing the various command-line
       Options you can use with SLOWINT1.
























                       SLOWINT1 1.00            Page 7 of 15



     SLOWINT1 will never install itself into memory more than once.  So, if
     SLOWINT1 has already been installed into memory, running it again with
     different Options will simply update (change the settings of) the
     SLOWINT1 that is already in memory.


     In addition to displaying error and status messages on the screen,
     SLOWINT1 also returns ErrorLevels to indicate what happened:

     THE IBM INTERRUPT SHARING PROTOCOL
     ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

     SLOWINT1 implements something called the "IBM Interrupt Sharing
     Protocol".  The details of the Protocol are pretty technical, and I
     won't go into them here.  I'm going to try to discuss, at a high level,
     the advantages (and disadvantages) of the Protocol, however.  As a user
     of SLOWINT1, there are some things you should know that are discussed
     here.  I'm also trying to promote the Protocol to other programmers, so
     you'll see a little bit of that bias in here, also.  Please bear with
     me.

     Most people who use DOS very much at all install several TSR's into
     memory at the same time (TSR's like DOSKEY, MSCDEX, and, of course,
     SLOWINT1).  There are also times when, for various reasons, you may want
     to (or need to) "Disable" a particular TSR.  You may either need to
     Disable it temporarily (and will later want to "Enable" it again), or
     you may want to Disable it permanently (and would prefer to "Uninstall"
     it from memory completely).  Unfortunately, many TSR's don't have
     "Enable" or "Disable" Options, and many also do not have "Uninstall"
     Options.

     Even if they do have an "Uninstall" Option, though, it is still possible
     that they cannot be Uninstalled from memory.  It is usually not possible
     to Uninstall a particular TSR unless it was the last TSR installed into
     memory (or at least very close to the last).  You must usually Uninstall
     TSR's in the reverse order they were installed (sometimes called FILO --
     First In, Last Out).

     For example, let's say you have 6 different TSR's in memory, all doing
     different things.  You need to "Disable" TSR #4, but it doesn't have a
     "Disable" Option.  It does have an "Uninstall" Option, but it can't be
     Uninstalled because TSR's 5 & 6 are "in the way".  In order to Uninstall
     TSR #4, you must first Uninstall TSR #6 (if you can), then Uninstall TSR
     #5 (if you can), then Uninstall TSR #4 (we're assuming here that you
     can), then re-install TSR #5 (if you can), then re-install TSR #6 (if
     you can).  Or, you can edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, REMark out the line
     that installs TSR #4, reboot the computer, do the thing you need to do
     without TSR #4, then edit AUTOEXEC.BAT again, un-REMark back in the line
     that installs TSR #4, and reboot again.  Talk about a PAIN!!

     Many years ago, IBM came up with a Protocol that solves this problem
     (and it is the only Protocol I've ever seen that even attempts to solve
     this problem).  IBM calls it the "Interrupt Sharing Protocol".  It is a
     Protocol that allows any TSR to remove itself from memory at any time,
     no matter how many programs were installed after it was.  I think it is
     a very good idea.  Unfortunately, in order for it to work properly, all
     programs need to use it (not just some programs, and not just TSR's). 
     For some reason, IBM didn't promote the Protocol very much, so not very
     many programmers even know about it, and, as a result, very few programs
     use it.  I consider myself fairly savvy about DOS (I have been writing
     TSR's for over a decade), and I first stumbled across this Protocol only
     a couple of years ago.

     The way "normal" (non-Protocol-using) programs work, you can't "see
     past" the last program installed into memory to be able to modify or
     remove any previously-installed programs.  This Protocol allows you to
     "see through" the later programs to find the early programs, so that
     they can be modified or removed.  If the TSR you're trying to Uninstall
     uses the Protocol, and all of the programs installed AFTER the one
     you're trying to Uninstall also use the Protocol, you can Uninstall the
     TSR with no problem.  It doesn't matter if the TSR's installed BEFORE it
     use the Protocol or not, all that matters is the programs installed
     AFTER it.


     There is one drawback to the Interrupt Sharing Protocol, however.  When
     you Uninstall a particular TSR, if it is not the last program in memory,
     it will leave a "hole" in your memory (where the TSR used to be).  If
     you later decide to re-install the same TSR, it is VERY unlikely that it
     will get installed into the same "hole" it was in before.  In fact, it
     is VERY unlikely that you will be able to use that memory hole again for
     any program -- it will probably be lost (wasted) until you reboot the
     computer again.  If there is even a remote chance that you will want to
     use the TSR again (before you reboot the computer), you should simply
     Disable the TSR instead of Uninstalling it from memory completely.  Not
     all TSR's have Disable/Enable Options, but any TSR sophisticated enough
     to use the Interrupt Sharing Protocol probably does.

     If the Protocol is used properly, it allows much greater flexibility in
     when and where and how you use TSR's.  If not used properly, however, it
     can actually end up being less efficient than if you just use TSR's that
     don't implement the Protocol (at least in terms of memory use).  Again,
     if there is even a remote chance that you will want to use the TSR
     again, you should not Uninstall it -- you should simply Disable it. 
     Only if you are certain that you will not need the TSR again (at least
     until you reboot the computer) should you attempt to Uninstall it.

     I will eventually be updating all of my programs to include the Protocol
     at some time in the future.  If you want more information about the
     Protocol, go to my Home Page:

       http://members.aol.com/bretjohn

     I have information there that will allow you to download the Protocol
     details.  You can also look at the source code for SLOWINT1, which is
     available from my Home Page.  It contains a working implementation of
     the Protocol, as well as some other stuff you might be interested in.

     A WORD FROM THE SPONSOR
     อออออออออออออออออออออออ

     SLOWINT1 is a free program.  If you like it and use it, do something
     nice for someone else in return.  I will accept niceties to myself in
     the form of $.

     You can freely copy and distribute SLOWINT1.COM, as long as it is
     distributed along with this SLOWINT1.DOC, and neither file has been
     modified in any way.  You cannot charge anyone in any way for SLOWINT1,
     except to recover your actual costs for disks and shipping (you cannot
     charge for "handling").  You do need my permission to distribute
     SLOWINT1 as a "companion" to some other program.

     You can also freely download the source code for SLOWINT1.  It is
     available from my web site:

       http://members.aol.com/bretjohn

     I haven't included the source code here, to keep the size of the
     download small, and because most people don't care about source code,
     anyway.  But it's available if you want it.


     As stated above, the main reason I wrote SLOWINT1 was to be a
     "companion" to my SLOWDOWN program.  SLOWINT1 will let you experiment
     with Trace Mode, so you can see exactly what it does (and what it
     doesn't) do.  I believe including SLOWINT1 will allow you to use the
     "main" program (SLOWDOWN) much more effectively.  You can use SLOWINT1,
     if you want, to Slow Down your computer.  I don't recommend it, however. 
     You will generally be much better off using SLOWDOWN instead.

     OTHER PROGRAMS
     ออออออออออออออ

     If you find SLOWINT1 useful, I have written some other programs you may
     find even more useful.

       CLOCK
          Shows a clock on your screen all the time.  Also has two alarms
          that beep at you when it's time for an appointment.

       JOYKEYS
          Lets you use your joystick with ANY program.

       MOUSKEYS
          Lets you use your mouse with ANY program.

       PRTSCR
          Sends all of your PrintScreens to a file instead of a printer.  A
          good way to transfer data between two programs, even if they won't
          normally "talk" to each other.

       PRTSCRFF
          Modifies your PrintScreen so that each new PrintScreen gets put on
          a new sheet of paper (especially useful if you have a Laser
          printer).

       SCANCODE
          Type keystrokes automatically in the middle of other programs. 
          Helpful in getting past the "starting screens" of most programs, or
          to create macros.  Can also be used to remap the keyboard.

       SDWRGMPD
          DOS driver for a Microsoft SideWinder digital GamePad.

       SERIAL
          Shows the status of your serial (COM) ports on screen.  Shows the
          bit rate, parity, status of the leads (DTR, DSR, etc.).  An
          excellent way to troubleshoot modem problems.

       SLOWDOWN
          Slows down a fast computer so you can run older programs that
          require a PC/XT or PC/AT.

     WARRANTY
     ออออออออ

     There is no warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, supplied
     with SLOWINT1.

     Although SLOWINT1 is small and simple, it is extremely powerful.  As
     mentioned above in the documentation, SLOWINT1 has some known
     compatibility problems.  It does not do anything that should cause any
     catastrophic failures, but you should still be very careful about how
     and why you use it.  Please read the documentation!

     If you find any "bugs" in this program, or see something that you wish
     were different, please let me know.


     HAVE FUN!

     I intend to always keep the latest versions of all of my programs on my
     own web site.  The URL is:

       http://members.aol.com/bretjohn

     Keep looking there for updates to my programs.  It is the first place I
     will put new or updated programs.  It is the only place I will put beta
     versions of new releases.
