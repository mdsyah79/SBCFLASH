     WHAT IS SLOWDOWN?
     อออออออออออออออออ

     SLOWDOWN is a DOS program that temporarily Slows Down your computer, so
     that it runs like one of the older, slower computers.  Of course,
     nowadays people are willing to spend a lot of money to make sure their
     computer is as fast as it can possibly be -- why would anyone in their
     right mind ever want to slow a computer down?  Believe it or not, there
     are a some really good reasons.

     The first reason is that there are many very good, useful (old) programs
     that were designed to run on the old, slow computers, and they do not
     run correctly on a new, fast computer.  The old programs either don't
     run at all (they "blow up" -- the computer totally locks up, or you get
     a "Run-time Error" or "Divide by Zero" of some sort), or they run in
     such a way that you can't use them.  When I first wrote SLOWDOWN (many
     years ago), about the only kinds of programs that really seemed to have
     problems were ones that required lots of "real-time" interaction with
     the user (like arcade-type games).  In my opinion, any program that
     requires such "real-time" interaction should be designed to run on any
     computer, no matter how fast (or how slow) it is.  Unfortunately, very
     few programs are actually designed that way.

     Nowadays, especially with the really fast computers, there are lots of
     different types of programs that have problems with fast computers (not
     just games).  I've personally seen or heard of different typing tutors,
     communications, network, database, and copy-protection programs that
     have problems on new computers.  I'm sure there is at least one program
     in just about any software category you could name that would either
     blow up or be unusable on one of the latest computers.  You can't even
     buy the old, slow computers anymore, but with SLOWDOWN you may still be
     able to use the programs.

     The second reason you may want to temporarily slow down your computer is
     when you are trying troubleshoot something that is going wrong with
     another program.  Sometimes, you know something is wrong, but things
     happen so fast you can't tell exactly what or even where the problem is
     (error messages or status messages flash by on the screen so fast you
     can't read them).  With SLOWDOWN, you may actually be able to see what's
     on the screen before it disappears again.













                       SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 3 of 75



     SLOWDOWN has several different "methods" or "modes" it can use to slow
     the computer down.  Some of the methods work better with certain
     computers or programs than other methods do.  Exactly what the different
     methods are, and when you may and may not want to use them, are
     described in the various sections below.  For now, suffice it to say
     that every reasonable method I know of to Slow Down computers is built
     into SLOWDOWN.  If SLOWDOWN is unable to Slow the computer Down
     appropriately, it probably can't be done at all.


     While SLOWDOWN is installed in memory, you are usually able to change
     the Speed of the computer with the keyboard using Hot-Keys, even while
     other programs are running.  The Hot-Keys are discussed in detail in the
     "HOT-KEYS" section below (page 44).  This lets you control exactly when
     and how fast your computer runs, and you can change the computer speed
     in "real time."  There are also several different ways of telling
     SLOWDOWN how fast you want your computer to run from the command-line
     (the different ways are discussed in the "OPTIONS" section below,
     starting on page 6).


     There are dozens of other "slowdown" programs already out there, so what
     makes SLOWDOWN different enough from the others that I even bothered to
     write it?  The main thing is flexibility -- SLOWDOWN includes in one
     program features that you may find sporadically in other "slowdown"
     programs, but never all together in one place.  SLOWDOWN also contains
     some features that I've NEVER seen in any other "slowdown" program. 
     SLOWDOWN is also very small (it only uses about 3000 bytes of memory),
     and, perhaps most importantly, is free.
























                       SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 4 of 75



     HOW TO USE SLOWDOWN
     อออออออออออออออออออ

     SLOWDOWN can be used in two basic ways.  The first way is to install
     SLOWDOWN "permanently" as a Terminate-but-Stay-Resident (TSR) program on
     your computer.  If you do this, the SLOWDOWN Hot-Keys will be available
     for you to use almost any time you want (see the "HOT-KEYS" section
     below on page 44).  You can instantly Slow Down or speed up your
     computer using the keyboard, even while other programs are running. 
     This gives you much more control of your computer than you have now.

     To have SLOWDOWN be "permanent" like this, you should make sure it is
     installed every time you turn your computer on.  You can do this by
     putting a simple "SLOWDOWN" line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  A
     "SLOWDOWN" line (with no Options) will install SLOWDOWN into memory, but
     SLOWDOWN will not do anything to change the speed of your computer yet. 
     You can then "activate" and "deactivate" SLOWDOWN when you want, either
     by using the HOT-KEYS, or by running SLOWDOWN again with command-line
     Options.  SLOWDOWN will never install itself into memory more than once,
     so if you do try to run it more than once, it will simply update (change
     the settings of) the SLOWDOWN that is already in memory.

     When installed as a TSR, SLOWDOWN only uses about 3K of memory.  This is
     not a lot of memory, but then again computer memory is quite precious.  
     You can use the DOS LH or LOADHI commands to load SLOWDOWN into High
     Memory (this will preserve more memory for your "normal" applications). 
     You can also Uninstall SLOWDOWN from memory completely with the
     UNINSTALL Option (page 40).


     Of course, many people would rather have the computer simply run as fast
     as it can nearly all of the time.  You may only have a few programs that
     require the use of SLOWDOWN, you don't want the SLOWDOWN Hot-Keys
     cluttering things up and confusing you, and you don't want SLOWDOWN
     wasting any of your computer's memory at times when it's not actually
     doing something.  You can also have SLOWDOWN Slow a single Program Down,
     and when that Program is finished, your computer will automatically
     return back to normal speed.  How to do this is discussed more fully
     under the PROGRAM Option below (page 29).


     SLOWDOWN is a DOS program, and, as with nearly all DOS programs, the
     easiest and best way to use it is in DOS batch files.  If you use any
     DOS programs at all (including most versions of Microsoft Windows, which
     are in fact nothing more than large, slow DOS programs themselves
     anyway), you really need to learn to write and use batch files.  It will
     save you literally hours of unnecessary work and frustration in the
     years to come.  There are some example batch file excerpts given in the
     sections below.  Once you figure out the settings you need to get
     SLOWDOWN to work with a particular program, for heaven's sake, write
     yourself a batch file to automate the process for you the next time.


                       SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 5 of 75



     OPTIONS
     อออออออ

     SLOWDOWN is fairly liberal in what it will accept as command-line
     Options.  Each Option must be entered separately, must start with a "/"
     (except the PROGRAM Option), and can either be upper- or lower-case. 
     The Options do not need to be separated by spaces (except the PROGRAM
     Option), and can be entered in any order (except the PROGRAM Option,
     which must be last).  If the same Option is entered twice with two
     different settings, or conflicting Options are entered, the last one
     entered takes precedence.  Options that require a number or character to
     be entered as part of the Option (indicated by a ":" separator in the
     Option details below) can either use a ":" or "=" as the separator.

     Note also that there are usually several different ways to enter the
     same Option.  For example, to have SLOWDOWN be QUIET (not give you any
     status messages as it is loading), you could type any of the following
     from the command line (or from a batch file):

       SLOWDOWN /Q
       SLOWDOWN /Quiet
       SLOWDOWN /ShutUp

     Most of the Options have a "shorthand" code ("/Q" in this case) and one
     or more "longhand" codes ("/Quiet" and "/ShutUp" in this example).  The
     shorthand codes take up less room and are faster and easier to type, but
     the longhand codes are easier to remember and to read and to understand. 
     You can use whichever makes the most sense to you.


     For instance, the following are equivalent:

       SLOWDOWN /Quiet/Speed=1000 PROGRAM ProgramOptions
       SLOWDOWN /Q        /s:1000 PROGRAM ProgramOptions


     The PROGRAM Option, if you have one, must be the last thing entered on
     the command-line.  The PROGRAM Option allows you to run a single
     executable PROGRAM (here called "PROGRAM ProgramOptions"), and after the
     PROGRAM is done, SLOWDOWN will automatically return the computer back to
     the way it was running before you started running PROGRAM.  The PROGRAM
     Option is discussed more fully below (page 29).











                       SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 6 of 75



     There are several Options to control how fast you want the computer to
     run.

     In general, the "speed control" Options have a wide range of input
     values.  At one end of the range of values, you will be telling SLOWDOWN
     to slow down the computer as much as it can.  If you select this value,
     SLOWDOWN will run the computer as slow as it believes it can safely do. 
     SLOWDOWN should not stop the computer completely, but the computer will
     run VERY slowly and may even seem like it is completely stopped.

     At the other end of the range of values, you will be telling SLOWDOWN to
     run the computer faster than it can possibly go.  In this case, SLOWDOWN
     will not Slow Down the computer at all.  Exactly what value you use to
     tell SLOWDOWN how much to slow the computer down depends on which "speed
     control" Option you decide to use.  This should become obvious as you
     read the details for each Option.


     Some of the "speed control" Options also refer to a thing called a
     Slowdown-Unit (or an SU).  This is a Unit of Speed that SLOWDOWN uses
     internally, both to measure how fast the computer is and to Slow the
     computer Down.  Slowdown-Units are unique to SLOWDOWN, and a slightly
     more detailed description of exactly what they are is given below in
     "HOW SLOWDOWN WORKS" (page 56).  When you see the references to
     Slowdown-Units or SU's, just remember that they are the "things"
     SLOWDOWN uses internally to measure Speed.


     * /M:nn
     * /MHz:nn  /MHz486:nn  /MHz80486:nn

          This Option tells SLOWDOWN to run your computer at approximately
          the same speed as a computer with a nn-MHz 80486 (or Pentium-
          something) CPU.  Then "nn" (the number of MHz) must be a number
          between 0 and 5000.  A MHz value of 0 runs the computer as slow as
          is safe, and a MHz value that is at least as large as your computer
          is capable of will not Slow the computer Down at all.

          In testing with SLOWDOWN, I have discovered that the only thing
          that really affects Speed significantly (at least for DOS programs)
          on new computers is how many MHz the CPU is running at.  It really
          doesn't matter whether the CPU is an 80486 or the latest version of
          Pentium-something (though the AMD chips are quite a bit faster than
          the equivalent Intel chips).  If Intel made a 2-GHz 80486, it would
          probably run pretty close to the same speed as a Pentium-4 running
          at 2-GHz (of course, Intel stopped making 80486's a long time
          before CPU speeds even got close to a GigaHertz).  For CPU's
          previous to the 80486 (80386, 80286, 80186, 8086, or 8088), the
          type of CPU as well as the CPU MHz both affect the speed.  There is
          a comparison of some CPU Speeds you can see with the TABLE Option
          described below (page 14).

     * /MHz286:nn
     * /MHz80286:nn

          This Option tells SLOWDOWN to run your computer at approximately
          the same speed as a computer with a nn-MHz 80286 CPU.  Then "nn"
          (the number of MHz) must be a number between 0 and 100.  This is
          very similar to the MHz486 Option directly above (page 7), except
          the reference CPU is an 80286 (the CPU used in the original IBM
          PC/AT) instead of an 80486.


     * /MHz8088:nn

          This Option tells SLOWDOWN to run your computer at approximately
          the same speed as a computer with a nn-MHz 8088 CPU.  Then "nn"
          (the number of MHz) must be a number between 0 and 100.  This is
          very similar to the both MHz486 and MHz286 Options above (pages 7
          and 8, respectively), except the reference CPU is an 8088 (the CPU
          used in the original IBM PC and PC/XT) instead of an 80486 or
          80286.

     * /P:nn.nn
     * /Percent:nn.nn  /Pct:nn.nn

          This Option tells SLOWDOWN to run the computer at approximately
          Nn.nn% (PERCENT) of normal speed.  The Nn.nn must be a number
          between 0.00 and 100.00, and can include precision down the 1/100
          of a percent (up to two numerals after the decimal point).  For
          instance, the following are acceptable percentage values to use:

            0  10  00010.0  0.13  .13  50.4  75.04  100  99.99  100.00

          The following percentage values would cause errors:

             -1      Can't be less than 0
            100.01   Can't be more than 100
              0.345  Can't have more than 2 numerals after the decimal point

          A PERCENT of 0 slows the computer down as much as is safe, and a
          PERCENT of 100 does not Slow the computer Down at all.

     * /X [:speed]
     * /XTSpeed [:speed]  /XTSpd [:speed]  /XT [:speed]
     * /XSpeed [:speed]   /XSpd [:speed]

          This is sort of like two Options in one.  If you simply do the "/X"
          (or "/XT" or "XTSpeed" or ...), you are telling SLOWDOWN to run the
          computer at approximately the same speed as an IBM PC/XT (a
          computer with a 4.77-MHz 8088 CPU).

          If you enter the ":speed" part of the Option (for example,
          "SLOWDOWN /X:100"), you are telling SLOWDOWN to change how fast it
          thinks an XT is.  If there, the "speed" part of the Option must be
          a number between 0 and 65535, and is the number of Slowdown-Units
          (SU's) you want SLOWDOWN to assume an XT is.  See the section
          below, "HOW SLOWDOWN WORKS" (page 56), for a more detailed
          explanation of Slowdown-Units.

          I have actually measured a computer with a 4.77-MHz 8088 CPU, and
          have found the Speed to be approximately 12 SU's (this is also
          detailed in the TABLE Option below on page 14).  For whatever
          reason, you may not agree with this.  Perhaps, for some reason, on
          your computer, you think a Speed of 20 SU's is more like what an XT
          is really like.  To change the SLOWDOWN XT-Speed to 20 Slowdown-
          Units, you would do a:

            SLOWDOWN /XT:20

          As long as SLOWDOWN is not UNINSTALLed from memory (see page 40),
          SLOWDOWN will continue to remember the XT-Speed that you told it. 
          Then, when you tell SLOWDOWN to run the computer at the same Speed
          as an XT (either with the plain XT command-line Option or by using
          the Hot-Keys described below on page 44), SLOWDOWN will use the XT-
          Speed you told it to use, instead of using the default value of 12
          SU's.  See "THE SLOWDOWN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE" below (page 41) for
          details on how you can make the XT-Speed change truly "permanent",
          even if you UNINSTALL SLOWDOWN from memory.


          It's important to note that there are really two different Options
          described here.  One Option (the one with the ":speed" part) simply
          tells SLOWDOWN what the XT-Speed should be, but does not actually
          change the speed of the computer.  The other Option (the one
          without the ":speed" part) is the one that will actually change the
          speed of the computer.  If you want to have SLOWDOWN both change
          the XT-Speed and to start running the computer at that XT-Speed at
          the same time, you will need to enter both Options.  For example:

            SLOWDOWN /XTSpeed=20 /XTSpeed





                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 10 of 75



     * /A [:speed]
     * /ATSpeed [:speed]  /ATSpd [:speed]  /AT [:speed]
     * /ASpeed [:speed]   /ASpd [:speed]

          This Option is very similar to the XT Option described directly
          above (page 10).  However, the XT Option above is based on the IBM
          PC/XT (4.77-MHz 8088 CPU), while this AT Option is based on the IBM
          PC/AT (8-MHz 80286 CPU).  Read the XT Option above if you want full
          details on exactly how this Option works.

          This AT Option tells SLOWDOWN to run the computer at approximately
          the same Speed as an IBM PC/AT (with an 8-MHz 80286 CPU).  If you
          enter the ":speed" part of the Option, you are telling SLOWDOWN to
          use the Speed you give it (in SU's) as the AT-Speed, instead of
          using the default (measured) AT-Speed of 54 SU's.  "Speed" can be a
          number between 0 and 65535.  Again, read the details of the XT
          Option (directly above, page 10), and replace "XT" with "AT" when
          appropriate.


     * /R [:speed]
     * /RememberSpeed [:speed]  /RememberSpd [:speed]  /Remember [:speed]
     * /RemSpeed [:speed]       /RemSpd [:speed]       /Rem [:speed]

          This Option is very similar to both the XT Option (above, page 10)
          and the AT Option (also above, page 11).  Read the XT Option above
          if you want full details on exactly how this Option works.

          While the XT and AT Options are based on specific models of
          computer (the IBM PC/XT and the IBM PC/AT, respectively), this
          REMEMBER Option can be based on anything you want it to be.  It is
          simply a particular Speed you want SLOWDOWN to REMEMBER for some
          reason, and want to easily be able to have SLOWDOWN start running
          the computer at that Speed.  You can use SLOWDOWN's HOT-KEYS (see
          page 44 below) to "switch" the computer to the REMEMBER-Speed (and
          also to set a new REMEMBER-Speed), which is probably the best way
          to use the REMEMBER Option.  See the HOT-KEYS section below (page
          44) for details on this.

          By default, the REMEMBER-Speed is set at 65535 Slowdown-Units,
          which means that it will not slow the computer down at all.  If you
          enter the ":speed" part of the Option, you are telling SLOWDOWN to
          use the Speed you give it (in SU's) as the REMEMBER-Speed, instead
          of using the default REMEMBER-Speed of 65535 SU's.  "Speed" must be
          a number between 0 and 65535.  Again, read the details of the XT
          Option (above, page 10), and replace "XT" with "REMEMBER-Speed"
          when appropriate.

     * /S:nn
     * /Speed:nn  /Spd:nn

     * /Slowdown-factor

          There are actually two Options described here, the SPEED Option
          (/S:nn, /Spd:nn, or /Speed:nn) and the SLOWDOWN-FACTOR Option
          (/Slowdown-factor).  Although they are in a sense "opposites" of
          each other, they are also very similar to each other.  Therefore,
          I'm going to describe them together.

          With the SPEED Option, you are telling SLOWDOWN how fast you want
          the computer to be (in Slowdown-Units or SU's) after it gets done
          Slowing the computer Down (and SLOWDOWN will calculate how much to
          Slow the computer Down to make that happen).  With the SLOWDOWN-
          FACTOR Option, you are telling SLOWDOWN how many SU's to Slow the
          computer Down by (and SLOWDOWN will leave however many SU's the
          computer has left for the other "real" programs to use).

          The "nn" in the SPEED Option, and the "Slowdown-factor" in the
          SLOWDOWN-FACTOR Option, must be a number between 0 and 65535, and
          is the number of Slowdown-Units (SU's) to "leave" (in the SPEED
          Option) or to "waste" (in the SLOWDOWN-FACTOR Option).  In the
          SPEED Option, the larger the number of SU's, the faster the
          computer will run.  In the SLOWDOWN-FACTOR Option, the larger the
          number of SU's, the slower the computer will run.  A SPEED of 0
          SU's will slow the computer down as much as is safe, and a SPEED at
          least as large as the computer is capable of running will not Slow
          it Down at all.  A SLOWDOWN-FACTOR of 0 SU's will not Slow the
          computer Down at all, and a SLOWDOWN-FACTOR at least as large as
          your computer is capable of will Slow the computer Down as much as
          is safe.





















                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 12 of 75



          A SlowDown-Unit (SU) is something unique to SLOWDOWN, and is the
          method of measurement it uses internally both to calculate the
          Speed of the computer and to Slow the computer Down.  If you're
          interested, a more detailed description of SU's is given below in
          "HOW SLOWDOWN WORKS" (page 56).  There is also a CPU Speed Table
          below under the TABLE Option (page 14) that shows the measured
          Speed of several different computers (in SU's).  You can compare
          your computer to this TABLE to see how fast your computer really
          is.


          Whether it is better to use the SPEED Option or the SLOWDOWN-FACTOR
          Option depends on exactly what you're trying to accomplish.  If
          you're trying to make your computer "perform like" some other
          particular computer that you just happen to know the SPEED of, the
          SPEED Option is probably easier to use.  If you're just trying to
          "Slow the computer Down some", the SLOWDOWN-FACTOR Option is
          probably the appropriate choice.


          If you want your computer to run the same speed as some other
          particular type of computer (like a PC/XT or a PC/AT), it is
          generally easier to use one of the other "speed control" Options
          (MHz486 - page 7, MHz286 - page 8, MHz8088 - page 8, PERCENT - page
          9, XT - page 10, or AT - page 11), instead of the SPEED or
          SLOWDOWN-FACTOR Options.  The SPEED and SLOWDOWN-FACTOR Options are
          really designed for "fine-tuning" SLOWDOWN for some special purpose
          (although it's entirely up to you exactly how you use SLOWDOWN).

          This Option shows you an on-line TABLE of CPU Speeds for different

          the TABLE is to help you figure out what kind of SPEED or SLOWDOWN-
          FACTOR Option you might want to use, since Slowdown-Units (which is
          what SLOWDOWN uses to measure Speed) are not something you're
          accustomed to remembering.  The on-line TABLE looks like this:

          If you want your computer to "look like" some other particular type
          of computer, and one of standard SLOWDOWN "speed-control" Options
          doesn't seem to work for you, you can use this TABLE.  Usually, one
          of the standard Options (/XT, /AT, /MHZ486, /MHz286, or /MHz8088)
          will do a pretty good job for you, but there may be times when they
          just aren't quite what you're looking for.  You can pick an
          appropriate Speed from the TABLE, and then possibly do a little bit
          of multiplication or division to get an exact fit for what you're
          trying to accomplish.






                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 14 of 75



          The Speed measurements in the TABLE were taken by booting the
          measured computer with a "clean" DOS floppy disk (nothing in
          CONFIG.SYS and nothing in AUTOEXEC.BAT), and then running SLOWDOWN. 
          If you use SLOWDOWN yourself to measure the Speed of a computer
          that is similar to one in the TABLE, you may find your actual
          measured Speed to be slightly different than the TABLE entry (but
          it should be pretty close).  In particular, every Driver or TSR you
          install (either with CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT) before running
          SLOWDOWN will cause the computer to Slow Down at least a little
          bit.  Trust me, the values in the TABLE are pretty accurate and you
          should not worry about trying to modify them (as I know some of you
          perfectionists will be tempted to do).


          If you have a really fast computer, and if you pay attention as you
          are using SLOWDOWN, you will notice that the Speed of your computer
          (as measured by SLOWDOWN) can vary from one time to the next.  For
          example, you can run SLOWDOWN once at get a measured computer Speed
          of 3000 SU's, and then run it again and get a measured Speed of
          3002 SU's.  This is due to the unpredictable nature of how long it
          takes other background Applications (like other TSR's you have
          installed in memory) to do what they need to do.  When running
          "real" DOS (not running a DOS Box underneath Windows), the numbers
          usually only vary by 1 or 2.  Underneath Windows, though, the
          numbers can vary significantly.  They usually don't vary by more
          than about 5, but I have seen them vary by as much as several
          hundred.  This is because of the unpredictable nature of Windows
          running other programs (including just itself) in the background.

























                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 15 of 75



          Also, if you have a really fast computer, you may notice that some
          programs do not run smoothly, especially if you are trying to slow
          the computer down a lot.  In other words, some programs are "jerky"
          (some parts of the programs run too fast, some parts run OK, and
          some parts run too slow).  Not all programs are jerky (at least not
          so jerky that you can't use them), but some are.  Again, this is
          due to the unpredictable nature of how long it takes to do any
          particular thing on the computer (newer computers don't do
          EVERYTHING faster than the old computers -- they only do SOME
          things faster).  The larger the discrepancy between the actual
          Speed of the Computer and the desired Speed, the more likely it is
          to be jerky.

          SLOWDOWN has several different "methods" it can use to slow down
          the computer.  These are discussed below (see the /UseInt08,
          /UseInt70, /UseCPUCache, and /UseTrace Options below on pages 19 -
          25).  Some of these methods are "smoother" (less "jerky") than
          others.  But, in general, the "smoother" the method works, the less
          compatible it is with certain other programs.  For example, the
          /UseInt08 method is the "jerkiest" method to use, but it ALWAYS
          works, and will slow down EVERY program you try to use it with. 
          The other methods (UseInt70, UseCPUCache, and UseTrace) are almost
          always "smoother" than /UseInt08, but sometimes they work and
          sometimes they don't.  This is all discussed in detail underneath
          the details for each specific Option (see pages 19 - 25 below).


          Some computers also have a way where you can change the speed (the
          actual MHz) of the CPU.  With some computers, you will need to get
          into the BIOS Setup when you first turn the computer on (which
          means you will need to reboot).  Other computers have a physical
          switch on the computer case (usually labeled "Turbo").  Your
          computer may also have some sort of BIOS Hot-Key that lets you do
          it from the keyboard (the most common Hot-Keys I've seen are
          <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<Grey-> to have the CPU run slow, and
          <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<Grey+> to have the CPU run fast).  Sometimes slowing
          down the actual CPU Speed before you run SLOWDOWN can help things
          run smoother, and sometimes can even let you avoid using SLOWDOWN
          altogether.

          If anyone wants to, they can also send me information on more
          computers that I can add to the TABLE.  I do have a few
          stipulations on what you should send me, however.  First of all,
          the computer MUST be booted with "clean" DOS (nothing in CONFIG.SYS
          and nothing in AUTOEXEC.BAT).  Also, you should verify what your
          CPU Type and Speed really are with an external program (I
          personally use a free program called NSSI).  I also really only
          want information on CPU's that are significantly different than
          those already in the Table, or that for some reason show my
          conclusion that "the CPU MHz number is the only thing that really
          affects things very much" is incorrect.  I would definitely like
          some tests performed on 8086, 80186, 80286, 80386, Pentium,
          Pentium 4, Celeron, and non-Intel CPU's (like AMD, Cyrix, and NEC).








































                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 17 of 75



     There are several Options to control how SLOWDOWN will Slow the computer
     Down.

     Before we discuss these particular Options, I think it is necessary to
     describe a little bit about how SLOWDOWN fundamentally works.  This will
     hopefully be relatively short and sweet -- a slightly more detailed
     description is given in the "HOW SLOWDOWN WORKS" section below (page
     56).

     There are certain hardware devices (Clocks) that are constantly keeping
     time in the background on your computer.  The Clocks, at very precise
     and periodic intervals, "interrupt" the computer to tell it that the
     Clock has been updated.  If a program needs to do something at regular
     (periodic) intervals, the program can monitor exactly when these Clock
     Interrupts occur and do whatever they need to do at the appropriate
     times.

     SLOWDOWN monitors these Clock Interrupts, and whenever appropriate,
     SLOWDOWN wastes some time.  To "Slow Down" the computer, SLOWDOWN
     basically has the CPU do a bunch of stuff that doesn't provide any
     useful output (sort of like what Windows does continuously).  While the
     CPU is busy doing the stuff SLOWDOWN wants it to do, the CPU can't do
     what any other "real" program wants it to do.  The other program won't
     get access to the CPU as much as it normally would, and, as a result,
     the other program effectively runs more slowly.

     All modern computers have two Clock Interrupts that can be monitored
     (VERY old computers only have one Clock).  The first Clock is called
     Interrupt 8, and every computer has it (even really old computers).  In
     fact, the Interrupt 8 Clock is so important to the operation of the
     computer that it cannot be changed and it cannot be stopped.  The only
     drawback with Interrupt 8 (at least as far as using SLOWDOWN is
     concerned) is that it only occurs about 18 times a second, and the
     frequency cannot be changed without REALLY screwing up the computer. 
     While 18 times a second seems pretty fast in human terms, it is pretty
     slow in computer terms.  When SLOWDOWN is using Interrupt 8 to Slow
     things Down, the computer can seem "jerky".

     The other Clock Interrupt (on modern computers) that can be monitored is
     called Interrupt 70.  The nice thing about Interrupt 70 is that it
     occurs much more often than Interrupt 8 (Interrupt 70 normally occurs
     1024 times a second).  In general, programs will appear to run
     "smoother" when SLOWDOWN is using Interrupt 70 than they do when
     SLOWDOWN is using Interrupt 8.  The drawback with Interrupt 70 is that
     it is not designed to be "shared" among different programs.  If one
     program is using Interrupt 70, it is just about impossible for another
     program to use it reliably at the same time.  If the program you're
     trying to Slow Down uses Interrupt 70 itself to do something (a lot of
     programs do), then it can (and almost always will) keep SLOWDOWN from
     working properly if SLOWDOWN is trying to use Interrupt 70 at the same
     time.

          that you can only use one at a time.  We are going to discuss them
          both at the same time.

          As discussed on the previous page, there are two different hardware
          Clocks that SLOWDOWN can "tie" itself to:  Interrupt 8 and
          Interrupt 70.  Interrupt 8 occurs approximately 18 times a second,
          and your computer can be "jerky" when SLOWDOWN uses Interrupt 8. 
          But, Interrupt 8 ALWAYS works (there's no way another program can
          stop it).  Interrupt 70 occurs 1024 times a second, and your
          computer will usually be "smoother" when SLOWDOWN uses Interrupt 70
          than when it uses Interrupt 8.  But, Interrupt 70 doesn't always
          work.  Another program can keep SLOWDOWN from Slowing the computer
          Down, or SLOWDOWN can keep the other program from working properly
          (or even cause it to crash).  There's no way of telling for sure
          whether any particular program will work with SLOWDOWN in Interrupt
          70 mode or not, so you will just have to experiment and see.

          You should be able to toggle back and forth between using Interrupt
          8 and Interrupt 70 whenever you want, and should not notice much
          (if any) difference in how fast the computer appears to be running. 
          Internally to SLOWDOWN, things work VERY differently when it is
          using Interrupt 8 than when it is using Interrupt 70.  But,
          SLOWDOWN is designed so that the "Slow Down effect" should be
          approximately the same no matter which Interrupt method it is
          using.  You may notice a very small amount of difference in Speed
          between the two Interrupt methods, but if there is a large
          difference, it probably means that the program you're trying to
          Slow Down is not compatible with Interrupt 70.  It's not really
          possible for a program to be "incompatible" with Interrupt 8.

          The way I would use SLOWDOWN if I were you (the way I use it,
          anyway) is this.  By default, SLOWDOWN uses Interrupt 8 (the most
          "compatible" Interrupt method).  For many, if not most, programs,
          Interrupt 8 will work just fine and you should not have any
          problems.  For the (hopefully very few) programs where Interrupt 8
          is too "jerky", try using Interrupt 70 instead.  If you find that
          Interrupt 70 works for that particular program, PLEASE write
          yourself a batch file to automate the whole SLOWDOWN thing for you
          the next time you run the program.  With the PROGRAM Option (page
          29, below) you can easily run a single program in Interrupt 70
          mode, and automatically return things back to the default Interrupt
          8 mode when the program is done.

          Before we talk about how this Option works, we need to discuss a
          little bit about exactly what the CPU Cache is.  All modern
          computers have a CPU Cache (all computers with at least an 80486
          CPU, which includes all Pentium-class computers).  The CPU Cache is
          a chunk of memory that is "special" in two ways: it is extremely
          fast (faster than "regular" memory), and it is "close" to the CPU
          ("closer" than regular memory).  As you will discover as you read
          on and play with SLOWDOWN, the Cache is the main thing that makes
          modern computers so much faster than older computers.  The Cache
          is, in fact, FAR more important than the MHz of the CPU in
          determining how fast your computer actually runs.

          Whenever a program requests that the CPU do something, the CPU will
          store the instructions in the Cache.  Programs, by nature, tend to
          do the exact same things over and over and over again.  So, if a
          program asks the CPU to do the same thing it did just a little
          while ago (which is pretty likely), it's possible that the
          instructions for what to do will still be in the Cache.  If so, the
          CPU will retrieve the instructions from the Cache instead of
          retrieving them from regular memory (which is much slower than the
          Cache), or from the hard drive (which is even slower than memory). 
          As CPU's have progressed, the Caches have gotten larger and faster,
          and do a better job of "guessing" what instructions the CPU may
          need in the near future.  This is the main reason that modern CPU's
          are so much faster than the older CPU's.  In fact, from what I can
          tell with my experimentation, the efficiency and effectiveness of
          the Cache seems to have FAR more effect on the "speed" of the
          computer than the MHz of the CPU.  In fact, if you simply Disable
          the CPU Cache on your computer, and don't do anything else, you
          probably won't believe how Slow your computer really is.


          It turns out that all CPU's with a Cache have also provided a
          standard, relatively easy way to Disable (turn off) the Cache. 
          When the Cache is Disabled, the computer will run MUCH slower than
          it normally does (usually, it will run somewhere between 5% and 20%
          of the "normal" speed).  Exactly how much the computer slows down
          when you Disable the Cache varies significantly from computer to
          computer, and is just about impossible to accurately predict -- it
          must actually be measured.  For the purposes of the rest of this
          discussion, let's just say that Disabling the Cache Slows the
          computer Down A LOT.




                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 21 of 75



          Another thing to note about Disabling the Cache is that although
          your computer runs much slower than normal, it will never be
          "jerky".  Disabling the Cache is about the closest thing you can do
          to simulate literally decreasing the MHz of the CPU to slow the
          computer down (which is something most computers won't let you do
          after the computer is already running).

          Because the effect of the Cache is so significant, and because it
          is a binary (on-or-off) kind of thing (it's not "adjustable"), it
          is very difficult for you to determine exactly when you may or may
          not want the Cache to be Disabled.  So, SLOWDOWN will automatically
          Control (Enable or Disable) the Cache when it is appropriate (and
          if you give it "permission" to do it).  If you give SLOWDOWN
          permission to Control the Cache, and you tell SLOWDOWN you want to
          make the computer run slow enough to get over the "CPU Cache Speed
          Hump", then SLOWDOWN will automatically Disable the Cache. 
          SLOWDOWN will then add in enough Slowdown Units (using Interrupt 8
          or Interrupt 70) to try and simulate the precise speed you
          requested.  Of course, when it's time to speed the computer back up
          again, SLOWDOWN will automatically re-Enable the Cache.


          This UseCPUCache Option is how you give (or deny) SLOWDOWN
          permission to Control (Disable and Enable) the CPU Cache
          automatically.  It is EXTREMELY important for you to keep in mind
          that this Option does NOT directly Enable or Disable the CPU
          Cache -- it simply gives permission (or denies permission) for
          SLOWDOWN to automatically Control the Cache at the appropriate
          times.

          By default, the UseCPUCache Option is Enabled (SLOWDOWN will
          automatically Disable and Enable the CPU Cache when appropriate). 
          If you don't want SLOWDOWN to be able to Control the Cache, set the
          Option to False (or Off or Disabled), by doing something similar to
          the following:

            SLOWDOWN /UseCPUCache: No
















                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 22 of 75



          Controlling, or even monitoring, the status of the CPU Cache is
          something that is normally only done at an "Operating System" level
          (it should NEVER be done by a "standard" Application).  In general,
          programs do not care whether the Cache is Enabled or not, so
          Disabling the Cache should not cause any compatibility problems. 
          Therefore, there is normally not a good reason to deny SLOWDOWN
          permission to Control the Cache, so you will probably just want to
          leave the permission Enabled (the default).  If you ever run into a
          program that is not compatible with a Disabled Cache (other than
          Microsoft Windows or HIMEM.SYS/EMM386.EXE), I would appreciate
          hearing about it.  If you do find such a program, for heaven's
          sake, write yourself a batch file to automate the whole process for
          you the next time you run the program.


          There are only two programs I have run across so far that have
          compatibility issues with the CPU Cache, and they are both made by
          Microsoft.  The first program is the combination of HIMEM.SYS and
          EMM386.EXE.  Technically, HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE are two
          distinctly separate programs, but for purposes of this discussion I
          will treat them as one, because they are dependent on each other. 
          Some versions of HIMEM.SYS/EMM386.EXE do not like to have the CPU
          Cache Disabled.  In particular, the version of HIMEM/EMM386 that
          came with DOS 6.22 crashes the computer whenever SLOWDOWN (or any
          other program) tries to Disable the CPU Cache.  There may also be
          other versions of HIMEM.SYS/EMM386 besides the one that came with
          DOS 6.22, or even other Memory Managers besides
          HIMEM.SYS/EMM386.EXE, that have the problem.  I don't know.  But I
          do know that the HIMEM.SYS/EMM386.EXE that came with DOS 6.22
          definitely has the problem.

          If your computer has the problem, SLOWDOWN will instantly lock up
          the computer as soon as you try and run it.  The fix for this is
          relatively simple -- replace HIMEM.SYS & EMM386.EXE with newer
          versions.  You can download the versions of HIMEM.SYS/EMM386.EXE
          that came with Windows 98 Second Edition from my web site
          (http://members.aol.com/bretjohn).  There is a much more detailed
          (and much more technical) discussion of exactly what this problem
          is down below, in the section called "EMM386.EXE AND THE CPU CACHE"
          (page 59).  If your computer locks up as soon as you run SLOWDOWN,
          please read that section down below to see what you can do to fix
          it.

          The other program I've run across that has a compatibility issue
          with a Disabled Cache is Microsoft Windows.  If you Disable the
          Cache before starting Windows, Windows crashes.  IMHO (In My Humble
          Opinion), Windows SHOULD just run slowly, like any other DOS
          program would do.  Instead, it crashes.  In addition, Windows will
          not let a DOS Program (like SLOWDOWN), running in a DOS Box
          underneath Windows, control the Cache.  Windows doesn't crash or
          anything, but it won't let the status of the Cache be changed from
          a DOS Box.  Therefore, underneath Windows, SLOWDOWN must do all of
          its Slowing-Down using other methods (Interrupt 8 or Interrupt 70),
          which, as a rule, aren't as smooth or as effective as Disabling the
          Cache.  This is one reason (though not the only reason) that
          programs running in a DOS Box underneath Windows will almost never
          run as well as they do under "real" DOS.


          I am also including with this distribution of SLOWDOWN a separate
          program called CPUCACHE.  It is a relatively simple program, that
          does just one thing -- Controls the CPU Cache.  It will Enable,
          Disable, Toggle, or simply show you the current status of the CPU
          Cache.  It includes its own documentation, so I won't go into
          details here.  The main reason for including it is to allow you to
          "mess around" with the CPU Cache if you want, to investigate
          exactly how it affects your computer.  SLOWDOWN functionally does
          the same thing that CPUCACHE does, but does it automatically at the
          appropriate times based on what you're trying to accomplish. 
          CPUCACHE gives you manual control of the Cache.

          Before we talk about how this Option works, we need to discuss a
          little bit about exactly what Trace Mode is.  All CPU's have a
          special Mode they can operate in, called "Trace Mode" or "Debug
          Mode" or "Single-Step Mode".  The main purpose for this special
          Mode is so that you can run a particular program "underneath"
          another special program called a Debugger.  The Debugger lets you
          Single-Step through the other program as it is running, temporarily
          stopping in between each CPU instruction.  This lets you see
          exactly what the program is doing, step by step, in minuscule
          detail.  That way, you can figure out exactly where problems (bugs)
          are happening so that you can fix (debug) them.  Programmers use
          Debuggers all the time.

          While the main reason for Trace Mode is to Debug programs, it turns
          out that you can use Trace Mode to do other things also.  SLOWDOWN
          is able to use Trace Mode to make the computer run MUCH more slowly
          than it regularly does.  When the CPU is in Trace Mode, the CPU
          runs a special "program" in between each "regular" CPU instruction. 
          The Special "program" associated with Trace Mode is called
          Interrupt 1.

          If you allow it to, SLOWDOWN will (at the appropriate times) put
          the CPU into Trace Mode, and run a special "SLOWDOWN program" for
          Interrupt 1.  Because the special "program" is performed between
          each CPU instruction, in effect, each "regular" CPU instruction is
          turned into several CPU instructions.  The extra Trace Mode CPU
          instructions really don't do anything useful (they just slow things
          down).




                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 25 of 75



          There are four facts that are pretty important for you to know
          about Trace Mode (at least as far as using SLOWDOWN is concerned). 
          The first thing to know is that, much like the UseCPUCache Option
          discussed above (page 21), it is a binary (on-or-off) thing.  It's
          not really possible to "adjust" the speed with the Trace Mode
          Option itself.

          The second thing to note about Trace mode is that it slows the
          computer down A LOT.  In Trace Mode, the computer will usually run
          at less than 2% of normal speed, which is even slower than it does
          when the CPU Cache is Disabled (see the UseCPUCache Option above,
          page 21).

          The third thing to note about Trace Mode is that it is EXTREMELY
          smooth (not "jerky" the way Interrupt 8, or even Interrupt 70, can
          be).  Because it is an extremely smooth way to slow the computer
          down a lot, it is extremely effective if you want to make a REALLY
          fast computer run REALLY slowly.  With this Trace Mode Option, I am
          able to perfectly run many, many programs designed for a PC/XT
          (4.77Mhz 8088 CPU) on my 350-Mhz Pentium-class computer.


          The last, and perhaps most important, thing to know about Trace
          Mode, is that it is EXTREMELY INcompatible with certain computers
          and programs.  It has so many compatibility issues, in fact, that
          you may not want to use it at all.  But, when the use of Trace Mode
          is appropriate, it is almost unbelievably effective.

          The first major compatibility problem with SLOWDOWN in Trace Mode
          is your computers clock.  While in Trace Mode, your computers clock
          may lose time.  I don't understand how or why it does this (it
          shouldn't), but sometimes it happens anyway.  So, if you use
          SLOWDOWN in Trace Mode, and you want your computers Date and Time
          to be correct, you may constantly need to be setting the correct
          Date and Time.  Someday, I may figure out why this is happening and
          fix it.  Until then, you may need to keep updating your clock.

















                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 26 of 75



          The second major compatibility issue with SLOWDOWN is Microsoft
          Windows.  Simply put, Windows HATES Trace Mode.  If you are running
          in a DOS Box underneath Windows, and try to put the CPU into Trace
          Mode, Windows will crash.  Sometimes it will crash the entire
          Windows Operating Environment, and sometimes it will just crash the
          DOS Box you were trying to turn on Trace Mode from.  Bottom line is
          that you can't use Trace Mode underneath Windows.  So, even if you
          give SLOWDOWN permission to use Trace Mode, it won't ever try to
          turn Trace Mode on while Windows is running.

          On one particular computer I've tested, Windows is EXTREMELY
          incompatible with Trace Mode.  Trace mode doesn't even need to be
          turned on when Windows is running for the computer to crash.  All
          SLOWDOWN needs to do is TEST Trace Mode before Windows starts, and
          Windows instantly crashes.  The specific computer that crashes on
          me is a Dell Laptop.  I have a Dell Desktop that was made about the
          same time as the Dell Laptop, and it works fine, so it's not a
          problem with all Dells.  The Dell Laptop is the only Laptop I've
          tested it on, so it's possible (though EXTREMELY unlikely) that the
          problem occurs on all (or at least many) Laptops.  It's also
          possible that my particular Dell Laptop is the only one with a
          problem (though I doubt that, also).  I just don't know.


          Now, after listening to me warn you about all of these
          compatibility issues, you may think I'm trying to discourage you
          from using Trace Mode.  I'm not.  I'm just warning you that if you
          do try to use it, you may run into some problems.  But, I can also
          tell you that, when used appropriately, Trace Mode is almost
          unbelievably effective in Slowing your computer Down.  In fact,
          sometimes, it is the only way you can slow your computer down A LOT
          and still have it be usable.





















                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 27 of 75



          Because it slows the computer down so much, it is very difficult
          for you to know exactly when it may or may not be appropriate to
          turn Trace Mode on.  So, SLOWDOWN will do it automatically for you
          at the appropriate times (if you give it "permission" to do it). 
          If you give SLOWDOWN permission to use Trace Mode, and you tell
          SLOWDOWN you want to make the computer run slow enough to get over
          the "Trace Mode Speed Hump", then SLOWDOWN will automatically put
          the CPU into Trace Mode.  SLOWDOWN will then add in enough Slowdown
          Units (using Interrupt 8 or Interrupt 70) to try and simulate the
          precise speed you requested.  When it's time to speed the computer
          back up again, SLOWDOWN will automatically put the CPU back into
          "normal" (non-Trace) Mode.

          This UseTrace Option is how you give (or deny) SLOWDOWN permission
          to automatically put the CPU into Trace Mode.  It is EXTREMELY
          important for you to keep in mind that this Option does NOT
          directly put the CPU into Trace Mode -- it simply gives permission
          (or denies permission) for SLOWDOWN to automatically do it at the
          appropriate times.


          By default, the UseTrace Option is Disabled (SLOWDOWN will NOT, by
          default, ever try to put the CPU into Trace Mode).  It is Disabled,
          by default, because of all the compatibility problems you can have
          with it.  If you want to give SLOWDOWN permission to automatically
          put the CPU into Trace Mode when appropriate, you must EXPLICITLY
          give it permission.  You can do this from the DOS command line:

            SLOWDOWN /UseTraceMode: Enabled

          You can also do it by setting the SLOWDOWN Environment variable
          (which you would probably do in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file):

            SET SLOWDOWN=/Trace:On

          See "THE SLOWDOWN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE" section below (page 41) for
          a little bit more information on the Environment, if you don't
          understand what that means.


          I am also including with this distribution of SLOWDOWN a separate
          program called SLOWINT1.  It is a small TSR program that puts the
          CPU into Trace Mode, just like SLOWDOWN does.  It includes its own
          documentation, so I won't go into details here.  The main reason
          for including it is to allow you to "mess around" with Trace Mode
          if you want, to investigate exactly how it affects your computer
          and how it affects other programs.  SLOWDOWN functionally does the
          same thing that SLOWINT1 does, but does it automatically at the
          appropriate times based on what you're trying to accomplish. 
          SLOWINT1 gives you manual control.

     There is an Option to run a single PROGRAM "slowly", after which
     SLOWDOWN will return the computer to the way it was running before.


     * {Program} [ProgramOptions]

          {Program} is the name of a single PROGRAM that you want SLOWDOWN to
          run "slowly", and [ProgramOptions] are the command-line Options
          that PROGRAM needs to operate correctly.  If you are using the
          PROGRAM Option, it MUST be the last Option on the command-line (any
          other SLOWDOWN command-line Options must come before it).  After
          PROGRAM is finished, SLOWDOWN will automatically return the
          computer to the way it was running before you started running
          PROGRAM.  For example:

            SLOWDOWN /MHz486=100 /UseInterrupt70  EDIT C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT

          will slow your computer down to approximately the same speed as a
          100-Mhz 80486 computer using the Interrupt 70 Method, and then
          start running "EDIT C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT".  Note that the HOT-KEYS
          (described below on page 44) will still work in EDIT, allowing you
          to change Speeds while using EDIT -- the "/MHz486=100" will simply
          set the Speed of the computer while EDIT is first starting.  When
          you exit out of EDIT, SLOWDOWN will automatically return your
          computer to the way it was running before you started EDIT.

          {Program} must be the name of an executable file (one that ends in
          .COM, .EXE, or .BAT).  You do not need to put the .COM, .EXE. or
          .BAT extension as part of {Program}, however.  When DOS is deciding
          which program it will run, it uses a set of internal rules which
          will totally ignore the extension that you give it anyway.  I won't
          go into details about how DOS decides which program to run, but
          will tell you that it involves internal DOS commands, the current
          directory (folder), the PATH environment variable, and filename
          extensions (though not the extension that you give it).  You'll
          need to read a book or magazine article or internet page on DOS if
          you want to know the details.

          Although you don't need a filename extension, you may need to
          include a drive and path (for example, "C:\DOS\EDIT" instead of
          just "EDIT") as part of {Program}.  If you don't, DOS may either
          not be able to find the PROGRAM at all, or, worse yet, may run the
          wrong PROGRAM (you could have two different versions of "EDIT", for
          example, and not even know it).  SLOWDOWN uses DOS to run the
          PROGRAM, so all of the DOS rules about file names, PATHs, etc.,
          apply.

          If you use this PROGRAM Option to run a single program "slowly",
          SLOWDOWN does not install itself permanently into memory as a TSR. 
          That is, after PROGRAM is finished running, SLOWDOWN removes itself
          from memory and returns your computer to exactly the way it was
          before you started.  SLOWDOWN doesn't use a lot of memory when
          installed as a TSR (just over 3000 bytes), but by using the PROGRAM
          Option, you can be sure SLOWDOWN doesn't use ANY memory at all
          except when it is actually doing something.

          Note that it is also possible to both install SLOWDOWN as a TSR and
          to run a single program "slowly".  For instance, you could do the
          following:

            SLOWDOWN /MHz486=50 /UseInt08
            SLOWDOWN /MHz486=25 /UseInt70 /DisableHotKeys PROGRAM1

          The first line installs SLOWDOWN as a TSR, and starts running the
          computer at the same Speed as a 50-MHz 80486 computer using the
          Interrupt 08 Method.  The second line will run PROGRAM1 (whatever
          that is) at an initial Speed of 25-MHz, using the Interrupt 70
          Method, and with the SLOWDOWN Hot-Keys Disabled.  After PROGRAM1 is
          done, the computer will automatically return to the way it was
          running before PROGRAM1 started (in this case, 50-MHz, using
          Interrupt 08, with Hot-Keys Enabled).  The SLOWDOWN TSR will
          continue to remain in memory (perhaps forever) even after PROGRAM1
          has stopped.  If you want to permanently remove the SLOWDOWN TSR
          from memory for some reason, you need to use the UNINSTALL Option
          (page 40 below).


          After the PROGRAM is done, SLOWDOWN will return the computer to the
          way it was before PROGRAM started.  That is, the Interrupt Method
          (UseInt08/UseInt70 - page 19), UseCache - page 21, UseTrace - page
          25, and Hot-Keys (ShiftMask - page 34, Enable/Disable - page 36,
          and Beep - page 37) are restored back to the way they were before. 
          This allows you to "temporarily" (long enough for a single program
          to run) change the Speed or Hot-Keys or Interrupt Method or
          whatever for compatibility or convenience reasons.  When the
          Program is finished, SLOWDOWN will automatically restore the
          "default" settings that you normally use.













                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 30 of 75



          You should not use the PROGRAM Option of SLOWDOWN to install
          another PROGRAM that is itself a TSR.  By definition, after a TSR
          is finished running (and has been "installed" into memory), it
          leaves part of itself behind in memory (it does not ever completely
          remove itself).  With the PROGRAM Option, SLOWDOWN completely
          itself from memory when it is done.  If PROGRAM is a TSR (which
          does not completely remove itself from memory when it is done), you
          can run into major problems.  In the best scenario, everything may
          work fine (though this scenario is highly unlikely).  In the
          middle-of-the-road scenario, you will be leaving unusable "holes"
          in your memory, even though all of the programs may work like
          they're supposed to.  In the worst scenario, your computer will
          crash and burn.

          If, for some reason, you want (or need) to use SLOWDOWN to install
          another Program that is a TSR, you should first install SLOWDOWN as
          a TSR (by NOT using the PROGRAM Option).  You can then either use
          HOT-KEYS (described on page 44) or command-line Options to have
          SLOWDOWN temporarily slow the computer down while the other TSR
          Program is installing.  After the other TSR is installed, you can
          return the computer back to normal Speed if you want (again, either
          with SLOWDOWN HOT-KEYS or command-line Options).































                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 31 of 75



          If you want to run several programs in a row "slowly" (instead of
          just a single PROGRAM), and have the computer automatically return
          to "normal" after you are done, there are three different ways you
          can approach it.  All three approaches will involve you writing
          batch files, however.  Let's say you want to run three separate
          programs in a row, called Program1, Program2, and Program3.  You
          want to have the computer be Slowed Down to 10% of normal speed for
          all three programs, and you want the computer to return to normal
          speed after the three programs are done.  Here are some different
          batch files you could use to do it.

          This first example installs SLOWDOWN as a TSR, runs the three
          Programs, and then UNINSTALLs the SLOWDOWN TSR from memory:

            BATCH1.BAT:
              SLOWDOWN /Percent=10
              Program1
              Program2
              Program3
              SLOWDOWN /Uninstall

          This second example actually slows down each Program individually
          (using the SLOWDOWN PROGRAM Option three separate times).  Because
          it does this all in the same batch file, though, it will appear
          almost as though the computer is continuously running "slowly" the
          whole time:

            BATCH2.BAT:
              SLOWDOWN /Percent=10  Program1
              SLOWDOWN /Percent=10  Program2
              SLOWDOWN /Percent=10  Program3

          This last example actually uses two separate batch files, and one
          batch file calls (runs) the other one:

            BATCH3A.BAT:
              SLOWDOWN /Percent=10  BATCH3B

            BATCH3B.BAT:
              Program1
              Program2
              Program3











                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 32 of 75



          Another thing to keep in mind when using the PROGRAM Option is that
          you will not know what the ERRORLEVEL (return code) of the PROGRAM
          you are running is.  ERRORLEVEL's are returned by all DOS programs
          after they execute.  Their main purpose is to allow DOS batch files
          to "automatically" make decisions about what to do next based on
          whether the previous Program worked properly or not.  However, the
          ERRORLEVEL of the SLOWDOWN'd PROGRAM is not returned when you use
          the PROGRAM Option with SLOWDOWN -- what is returned is the
          SLOWDOWN ERRORLEVEL (see "ERRORLEVELS" below on page 43).  Let's
          compare the following two excerpts from batch files designed to run
          PROGRAM1 "slowly", and then remove SLOWDOWN from memory:

          BATCH1.BAT:
              SLOWDOWN /AT
              PROGRAM1
              IF NOT ERRORLEVEL 1 GOTO NoError
                REM Handle the PROGRAM1 Error Here
            :NoError
              SLOWDOWN /Uninstall
                REM This could be "SLOWDOWN /0", if you don't
                REM   want to completely remove SLOWDOWN from memory.

          BATCH2.BAT:
            SLOWDOWN /AT PROGRAM1
              REM Can't do a PROGRAM1 ERRORLEVEL check Here!

          As you can see by the REMark lines, with the first batch file
          (BATCH1.BAT), you can do any sort of ERRORLEVEL stuff related to
          PROGRAM1 you want.  In the second example (BATCH2.BAT), the
          ERRORLEVELs from PROGRAM1 are "lost", and you can't use them to do
          any sort of "smart" Batch file programming.  If you don't need or
          don't care about or don't understand ERRORLEVELs, then it doesn't
          matter which method you use to run PROGRAM1.  If the PROGRAM1
          ERRORORLEVELs matter to you for some reason, then you must install
          SLOWDOWN as a TSR, and then Uninstall it after PROGRAM1 is finished
          (look at BATCH1.BAT).

          When using the PROGRAM Option, SLOWDOWN requires quite a bit more
          memory than it does as a TSR.  When using the PROGRAM Option,
          SLOWDOWN itself requires just over 4500 bytes (4.5K) of memory.  In
          addition, when using the PROGRAM Option, SLOWDOWN loads a temporary
          copy of the DOS Command Shell (usually, this is COMMAND.COM).  The
          memory required by the DOS Command Shell is normally somewhere
          between 3K and 8K (exactly how big it is depends on which version
          of DOS you're using and how you have DOS configured).  Therefore,
          the total amount of memory required by SLOWDOWN when using the
          PROGRAM Option will usually be somewhere between 8K and 13K (a lot
          more than the 3K required by SLOWDOWN when it is installed as a
          TSR).  There is a more detailed discussion of this below in the
          "THE DOS EXEC FUNCTION AND COMMAND.COM" (page 65), if you're
          interested.


                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 33 of 75



     There are Options to configure and control the Hot-Keys.


     * /K:shift-mask
     * /Hot-KeyShiftMask:shift-mask  /Hot-KeySftMask:shift-mask
     * /HotKeyShiftMask:shift-mask   /HotKeySftMask:shift-mask
     * /Hot-KeyMask:shift-mask       /Hot-Key:shift-mask
     * /HotKeyMask:shift-mask        /HotKey:shift-mask
     * /KeyShiftMask:shift-mask      /KeySftMask:shift-mask
     * /KeyMask:shift-mask           /Key:shift-mask
     * /ShiftMask:shift-mask         /SftMask:shift-mask

          This Option is used to set the SHIFT-MASK for the SLOWDOWN Hot-
          Keys.  These Hot-Keys allow you to control the speed of the
          computer with the keyboard, even while you are in the middle of
          another program.  There are several keys on the keyboard that
          SLOWDOWN uses to do this, which are described more completely in
          the "HOT-KEYS" section below (page 44).

          It actually takes four "pieces" for the Hot-Keys to work, though. 
          There are the Hot-Keys themselves (described in the "HOT-KEYS"
          section below, page 44).  In addition, there are three different
          command-line Options associated with the Hot-Keys: the
          ENABLE/DISABLE Options described directly below (page 36), the BEEP
          Option described below that (page 37), and the SHIFT-MASK Option
          (discussed right here).


          The SHIFT-MASK is some combination of the <Shift>, <Ctrl>, and
          <Alt> keys that must be already be pressed before you press one of
          the Hot-Keys.  The default SHIFT-MASK that SLOWDOWN uses is
          <Ctrl>-<Alt>.  To change the SLOWDOWN SHIFT-MASK, you give SLOWDOWN
          (as the "shift-mask" part of the Option) a list of shift-keys
          (Shift, Ctrl, or Alt) that you would like it to use, separated by
          dashes ("-").

          For example, to change the SHIFT-MASK from whatever it was before
          to <Shift>-<Alt>, you could do the following:

            SLOWDOWN /ShiftMask = Shift-Alt













                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 34 of 75



          The SHIFT-MASK can be any combination of 0, 1, 2, or all 3 shift-
          keys, and the order doesn't matter ("Shift-Alt" is the same as
          "Alt-Shift", etc.).  Here are the words you can use to describe
          each of the shift-keys in the "shift-mask" part of the Option:

            Shift  Sft  S
            Control  Cntrl  Cntl  Ctrl  Ctl  C  Strg  Stg
            Alt  AltGr  A

          You can also have the SHIFT-MASK be "nothing" (no shift-keys at
          all) by using one of the following as the "shift-mask":

            0  Empty  Nada  No  None  Nothing  Nil  Null


          Although SLOWDOWN will let you set the SHIFT-MASK to "Nothing", or
          to a simple "Shift" key, under normal circumstances you do not want
          to do this.  It can cause you a great amount of confusion and
          weeping, since you will probably think your keyboard is broken
          (trust me -- I went through this more than once as I was testing
          SLOWDOWN, and it was not at all fun).


          Here are some "shift-mask" Options that would be OK:

            S-C-A  Sft-Ctl-Alt  Control  Alt-Cntrl  None

          These "shift-mask" Options would generate error messages:

            Ctrl-Ctrl    Can only use the same shift-key once
            None-Shift   The None shift-mask must be by itself
            Ctrl Alt     Must put a dash ("-") between each shift-key


          Again, exactly what the Hot-Keys are and how to use them is
          discussed in detail below in the "HOT-KEYS" section (page 44). 
          Read that section if you want to know more.
















                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 35 of 75



     * /E
     * /EnableHot-Keys  /EnableHotKeys  /EnableKeys  /Enable  /On

     * /D
     * /DisableHot-Keys  /DisableHotKeys  /DisableKeys  /Disable  /Off

          These Options allow you to ENABLE (turn on) or DISABLE (turn off)
          the SLOWDOWN Hot-Keys.  Exactly what the Hot-Keys are and what they
          do is described below in the "HOT-KEYS" section (page 44).  In
          addition, the SHIFT-MASK Option discussed directly above (page 34),
          and the BEEP Option discussed directly below (page 37), detail more
          aspects of the Hot-Keys.  These ENABLE and DISABLE Options control
          only one particular aspect of getting the SLOWDOWN Hot-Keys to
          work.

          By default, the SLOWDOWN Hot-Keys are ENABLEd.  This means that, by
          default, if you press one of the appropriate SHIFT-MASK and Hot-Key
          combinations, SLOWDOWN will change the Speed of the computer
          "on-the-fly" even if you are in the middle of another program.  If
          you want to turn the Hot-Keys completely off, you will need to
          DISABLE them (by giving SLOWDOWN the DISABLE Option).


          Under normal circumstances, it is best to leave the Hot-Keys
          ENABLEd all the time, especially if you have the SHIFT-MASK set to
          something relatively obscure (like the default SHIFT-MASK of
          <Ctrl>-<Alt>).  If the SHIFT-MASK (discussed above) is "uncommon",
          and if the BEEP Option (discussed directly below) is Enabled, it is
          very unlikely that you can accidentally change the Speed of your
          computer without knowing it.

          The only reason you might want to DISABLE the Hot-Keys is if, for
          some reason, you don't want to be able to change the Speed of the
          computer "on-the-fly", and you are also afraid, for some reason,
          that you will accidentally type a SLOWDOWN Hot-Key and not realize
          that you did it.  As long as you realized that the Speed of the
          computer has changed, even if you did it by accident, you should
          easily be able to "undo" the change with another Hot-Key.

          Again, read the "HOT-KEYS" section below (page 44) if you want
          details on exactly what the Hot-Keys are and what they do.












                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 36 of 75



     * /B:Yes|No
     * /Beep:Yes|No  /SpeedBeep:Yes|No  /SpdBeep:Yes|No

       Synonyms for Yes: Y True  Enable  Enabled  On
       Synonyms for No:  N False Disable Disabled Off

          This Option allows you to control whether or not SLOWDOWN BEEPs at
          you or not when you use the Hot-Keys to change Speeds "on-the-fly". 
          Exactly what the Hot-Keys are and what they do is described below
          in the "HOT-KEYS" section (page 44).  In addition, the SHIFT-MASK
          Option discussed above (page 34), and the ENABLE/DISABLE Options
          described directly above (page 36), detail more aspects of the Hot-
          Keys.  This BEEP Option controls only one particular aspect of
          getting the SLOWDOWN Hot-Keys to work.

          Normally, when you use one of the Hot-Keys to change the Speed of
          the computer "on-the-fly", SLOWDOWN will BEEP at you (see the "HOT-
          KEYS" section below on page 44 if you don't understand Hot-Keys). 
          The frequency of the BEEP is proportional to the Speed of the
          computer.  That is, a high-pitched BEEP indicates that the computer
          is running fast (SLOWDOWN is not Slowing things Down very much),
          and a low-pitched BEEP indicates that the computer is running
          slowly (SLOWDOWN is Slowing things Down a lot).  In certain
          programs, you may need to change the Speed of the computer every
          little while, and the constant BEEPing can become quite annoying.


          When BEEP is set to Yes (or On or Enabled or True), SLOWDOWN will
          BEEP at you when you change Speeds with a Hot-Key.  This lets you
          know that SLOWDOWN did in fact recognize what you wanted it to do,
          and the Computer is now running at the "new" Speed.  As stated
          above, the frequency (pitch) of the BEEP gives you an indication of
          just how fast the computer is running.  When BEEP is set to No (or
          Off or Disabled or False), SLOWDOWN will still change the Speed of
          the Computer when you press a Hot-Key, but it will not BEEP at you
          to give you a positive indication that it actually did anything. 
          Of course, the computer will generally start reacting "differently"
          (either faster or slower) than it did before you pressed the Hot-
          Key, but most of the time it's better (and safer) to get that
          immediate, positive indication that something actually happened.

          It is usually best to leave BEEPing Enabled (which it is by
          default).  The only time I can imagine where you would really want
          to turn off the BEEPing is in a program where you know you are
          going to constantly be changing the computer speed with Hot-Keys,
          and the BEEPing really annoys or distracts you.

          Keys, just as a reminder to you of what they are (in case you
          forget).  The Table looks something like the Hot-Key Table below on
          page 44.

     There are also some miscellaneous (housekeeping) Options.
     * /Q
     * /Quiet /ShutUp

     * /V
     * /Verbose /Talk

          These Options are complements of each other.  With the VERBOSE
          Option selected, when you type "SLOWDOWN {Options}" at the command-
          line, SLOWDOWN provides you with several lines of information about
          how SLOWDOWN is currently configured (information such as the Speed
          of your computer and the current status of the SHIFT-MASK). 
          Exactly what SLOWDOWN tells you depends on several factors, so I
          won't go into details (you can view the information for yourself). 
          However, this information does take up several lines of your
          screen, and can in fact clutter up your screen with a lot of stuff
          you may not normally care to see.

          With the QUIET Option selected, SLOWDOWN does not display any of
          this information.  Your screen is much less cluttered, but it is
          also not telling you some things that you may want to know about
          what SLOWDOWN is doing (you are "running blind").  Note that
          SLOWDOWN will always print error messages to the screen, even if
          the QUIET Option is set.  The QUIET Option only prevents
          configuration information from being displayed, not error
          information.

          The most common way to use the QUIET and VERBOSE Options is with
          the SLOWDOWN Environment variable (see "THE SLOWDOWN ENVIRONMENT
          VARIABLE" below on page 41).  If you want SLOWDOWN to normally be
          QUIET, set the QUIET Option in the SLOWDOWN Environment variable. 
          If you then decide, for some reason, that you want to temporarily
          override the QUIET Option so SLOWDOWN will show you what it is
          doing, you can enter the VERBOSE Option on the command-line.  Read
          "THE SLOWDOWN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE" section below (page 41) for
          more details.

          The default is for SLOWDOWN to be VERBOSE.

     * /U
     * /Uninstall /Remove /Out

          This will permanently UNINSTALL (or at least try to UNINSTALL)
          SLOWDOWN from memory, if it was installed as a TSR (if it was not 
          installed with the PROGRAM Option described above, page 29).  If
          all you are trying to do is stop Slowing the computer Down, you can
          just use an appropriate speed-control Option (such as
          "SLOWDOWN /0", "SLOWDOWN /Speed=65535", "SLOWDOWN /Percent=100", 
          or "SLOWDOWN /MHz486=5000").  This UNINSTALL Option will stop
          Slowing the computer Down just like one of the speed-control
          Options, but will also attempt to remove the SLOWDOWN TSR from
          memory.  If SLOWDOWN is successfully UNINSTALLed, there will be
          about 3000 bytes more memory for other programs to use, and the
          SLOWDOWN Hot-Keys will be permanently Disabled.


     * /?
       /H /Help

          This Option will pull up a HELP screen which gives a quick summary
          of the possible command-line Options for SLOWDOWN.  This will also
          give you a quick summary of how fast SLOWDOWN thinks your computer
          is, without actually Slowing the computer Down, or without
          installing itself into memory.

     THE SLOWDOWN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
     อออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

     SLOWDOWN also looks for an Environment variable called SLOWDOWN.  This
     variable can contain some of the standard command-line Options listed
     starting above on page 6.  The Options it CANNOT contain are the Options
     that directly change the speed of the computer (/MHz486:nn, /MHz286:nn,
     /MHz8088:nn, /Percent:nn.nn, /Speed:nn, /Slowdown-Factor, /XT, /AT,
     /Remember), or the PROGRAM Option.  The SLOWDOWN Environment variable
     CAN contain any of the other Options detailed above (/XT:speed,
     /AT:speed, /Remember:speed, /UseInt08, /UseInt70, /UseCPUCache:Yes|No,
     /UseTrace:Yes|No, /Table, /ShiftMask:shift-mask, /Enable, /Disable,
     /Beep:Yes|No, /Quiet, /Verbose, /Uninstall, or /Help).

     SLOWDOWN reads the Options from the SLOWDOWN Environment variable before
     it reads the Options from the DOS command-line.  Any Options you have in
     the SLOWDOWN Environment variable act like they are entered at the
     beginning of each command-line, and effectively become your "default"
     settings.  Because Options entered later on the command-line take
     precedence over Options entered earlier on the command-line, though, you
     can easily override the "default" settings contained in the Environment
     variable any time you want.  For example, let's say you set the SLOWDOWN
     Environment variable as follows:

       SET SLOWDOWN=/ShiftMask:Shift-Alt /XTSpeed:20

     This would SET the "default" SLOWDOWN SHIFT-MASK to <Shift>-<Alt>, and
     also SET the "default" XT-Speed to 20 Slowdown-Units.  Let's say you
     then ran SLOWDOWN as follows from the command-line (or a batch file):

       SLOWDOWN /ShiftMask:Ctrl-Alt

     The combination of the Environment variable and the command-line Options
     would act as if you had done this:

       SLOWDOWN /ShiftMask:Shift-Alt /XTSpeed:20 /ShiftMask:Ctrl-Alt

     You have overridden the "default" SHIFT-MASK (<Shift>-<Alt>) with a
     "temporary" SHIFT-MASK (<Ctrl>-<Alt>).  SLOWDOWN will continue to use
     the "temporary" SHIFT-MASK until you run SLOWDOWN at the command-line
     again, when it will start using the "default" SHIFT-MASK from the
     Environment variable again.  Also, Environment variables are "permanent"
     (they continue to be remembered by the computer until they are reset or
     until DOS stops running).  This means that even if you UNINSTALL
     SLOWDOWN from memory, SLOWDOWN will still know about the "default"
     settings next time you run it.







                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 41 of 75



     Although you can SET Environment variables at any time from the DOS
     command-line (or from batch files), it is usually better to SET them in
     your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  That way, they are truly "permanent", and will
     automatically be there every time you start your computer.  Another
     thing you need to know about Environment variables is that, with some
     versions of DOS, an Environment variable cannot contain an equals ("="). 
     In the SLOWDOWN Options, Equals ("=") and Colon (":") are
     interchangeable.  You should try to remember to use ":" when setting
     Environment variables, but can either use ":" or "=" on the command-
     line.  For instance, let's compare the following two lines which SET the
     SLOWDOWN Environment variable:

       SET SLOWDOWN= /ATSpeed = 100
       SET SLOWDOWN= /ATSpeed : 100

     The first line may not work on some computers, but it would on others. 
     The second line will work on all computers.


     If you do not have the QUIET Option set (above, page 39), or temporarily
     override the QUIET Option with the VERBOSE Option (also above on page
     39), SLOWDOWN will show you what the SLOWDOWN Environment variable is
     set to every time you run it.  If SLOWDOWN is doing something that you
     don't expect it to, it could be because of a setting you put in your
     Environment variable and forgot was there.  When troubleshooting, make
     sure you look at the SLOWDOWN Environment variable -- that could be
     where the problem is.

     If you don't know what an Environment is, or what it is used for, I
     suggest you read about it in your favorite DOS book.

     ERRORLEVELS
     อออออออออออ

     SLOWDOWN sets the following ERRORLEVELs after it executes, to give you
     an indication of what happened.  If you don't understand the purpose or
     value of ERRORLEVELs, I suggest you read about them in your DOS manual.

     HOT-KEYS
     ออออออออ

     SLOWDOWN has several Hot-Keys that you can use to control and change the
     speed of the computer "on-the-fly", even while you are in the middle of
     another program.  There are some command-line Options that also control
     certain aspects of how the Hot-Keys work (specifically, the SHIFT-MASK
     Option on page 34, the ENABLE/DISABLE Options on page 36, and the BEEP
     Option on page 37).  Read the details about those Options if you want
     more information.

     In the following Table, though, we will assume that the SHIFT-MASK is
     set at the default value of <Control>-<Alt> (see page 34), and that the
     Hot-Keys are ENABLEd (see page 36).  Here are the Hot-Keys, and what
     they will do if you press them:

                                   HOT-KEY TABLE
       อออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<`>     Run at 0% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:0)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<1>     Run at 10% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:10)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<2>     Run at 20% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:20)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<3>     Run at 30% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:30)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<4>     Run at 40% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:40)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<5>     Run at 50% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:50)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<6>     Run at 60% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:60)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<7>     Run at 70% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:70)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<8>     Run at 80% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:80)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<9>     Run at 90% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:90)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<0>     Run at 100% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:100)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<->     Lower the computer speed by one Slowdown-Unit
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<=>     Increase the computer speed by one Slowdown-Unit
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<BkSp>  Lower the computer speed by approximately 1%
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<Tab>   Increase the computer speed by approximately 1%
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<X>     Run at XT-Speed  (like /XT)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<A>     Run at AT-Speed  (like /AT)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<R>     Run at the REMEMBER-Speed  (like /Remember)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<S>     Store the current Speed as the REMEMBER-speed

     If the SHIFT-MASK is something other than <Ctrl>-<Alt>, you should
     replace the "<Ctrl>-<Alt>" parts of the table with the appropriate
     SHIFT-MASK.  If the Hot-Keys are DISABLED (see page 36), then pressing
     the Hot-Keys will, of course, not do anything at all.

     When you press one of the Hot-Keys (causing SLOWDOWN to do something to
     the Speed of the Computer), and if the BEEP Option is Enabled (see page
     37), SLOWDOWN will BEEP at you.  The frequency (or pitch) of the beep
     corresponds to the current speed of the computer.  A low-frequency beep
     indicates the computer is running slowly (such as when you press <Ctrl>-
     <Alt>-<`>), and a high-frequency beep indicates the computer is running
     quickly (such as when you press <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<0>).



                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 44 of 75



     It is also possible that when you try to change the speed of the
     computer with a Hot-Key, SLOWDOWN will not change the speed of the
     computer at all.  If SLOWDOWN is not sure how fast your computer is when
     you press a Hot-Key, it will simply beep at you twice (and not change
     the computer speed).  SLOWDOWN will only do this under certain
     circumstances if you are using Microsoft Windows.  It revolves around
     the fact that "real" DOS is several times faster than a DOS box running
     underneath Windows, and the details are discussed below under "SLOWING
     DOWN DOS PROGRAMS UNDERNEATH WINDOWS" (page 53).


     Also note that the Hot-Keys that are numbers (<1>, <2>, etc.) are the
     number keys along the top row of the keyboard, NOT on the NumberPad on
     the right side of the keyboard.  In addition, the descriptions given for
     the Hot-Keys are only accurate for a standard United States English
     keyboard.  If you use any other kind of keyboard, the descriptions may
     not be accurate (the Hot-Keys are determined by the physical location of
     the keys on the keyboard, not on how the keys are labeled).


     There may also be times when you're in the middle of another program and
     the Hot-Keys don't do anything (they don't beep at you and they don't
     change the speed of the computer).  This happens when the other program
     completely "takes over" the keyboard and doesn't allow any other program
     (like SLOWDOWN) to use the keyboard at the same time (Windows is one
     program that completely takes over the keyboard like this).  If you
     press a keystroke that the program doesn't understand (like one of
     SLOWDOWN's Hot-Keys), a program should assume that there might be a TSR
     that does understand the keystroke.  Unfortunately, not all programs do
     what I think they should.

     You will not be able to use the Hot-Keys in a program that completely
     takes over the keyboard like this.  Instead, you will have to set the
     correct computer Speed BEFORE the program starts.  And, to automate the
     entire process, you will probably want to create yourself a batch file.

     SLOWDOWN AND WINDOWS
     ออออออออออออออออออออ

     When talking about SLOWDOWN and its interaction with Microsoft Windows,
     we need to talk about things at two different "levels".  The first level
     concerns how you can use SLOWDOWN to Slow Down Windows itself, and to
     Slow Down Windows-native applications.  Version 1 of SLOWDOWN was able
     to Slow Down Windows, but I removed that capability in version 2 (it's
     still hard for me to believe that people actually WANT to make Windows
     run slower than it already does).  Because enough people inquired about
     the ability to Slow Down Microsoft Windows again, though, I added that
     capability back into version 3 of SLOWDOWN.  See the section below,
     "SLOWING DOWN WINDOWS AND WINDOWS-NATIVE APPLICATIONS" (page 48), for
     details.

     I will let you know this up front, though.  Because SLOWDOWN is a DOS
     application, not a Windows-native application, and because of the nature
     of how Windows works, SLOWDOWN has some pretty severe limitations and
     quirks about it that you may not like when you are trying to Slow Down
     Windows.  If that is the case, you may want to use a Windows-native
     slowdown-type program when you are trying to Slow Down Windows-native
     applications, instead of using SLOWDOWN.  There are several Windows-
     native slowdown-type programs available.

     There are also some Windows-native Slowdown-type programs that can Slow
     Down DOS applications running underneath Windows (in what Windows calls
     a "DOS Box").  Again, because of the nature of how Windows works,
     though, Windows-native slowdown-type programs have some pretty severe
     limitations and quirks when they are trying to Slow Down DOS programs. 
     Typically, a DOS program (like SLOWDOWN) does a MUCH better job of
     Slowing Down DOS programs than a Windows-native program can ever do (and
     vice-versa).


     The second level of interaction between SLOWDOWN and Windows concerns
     Slowing Down DOS applications that are run "underneath" Windows (in DOS
     Boxes).  See the section below, "SLOWING DOWN DOS PROGRAMS UNDERNEATH
     WINDOWS" (page 53), for details.

     In general, SLOWDOWN does a very good job of Slowing Down DOS programs,
     whether you are using "real DOS" or using a DOS Box underneath Windows. 
     Underneath Windows, though, things work a little bit differently than
     they do under real DOS.  In order for you to understand what's going on,
     I'm going to explain a few technical details about Microsoft Windows. 
     Some (perhaps many) of you will be quite upset with me and believe I'm
     wasting your time by going into this much detail.  But if you read on,
     you will probably learn some things that you should have known already
     (things that Microsoft won't tell you).  I can almost certainly
     guarantee that this may shed some light on why you've had trouble with
     Windows in the past, and why you'll probably always have trouble using
     Windows in the future.


                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 46 of 75



     While there have been several different versions of Microsoft Windows
     over the years, they can be classified into two general categories: 
     DOS-based versions and NT-based versions.  The DOS-based versions
     include 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 9x, and ME.  The NT-based versions include NT,
     2000, and XP.  Microsoft claims that all future versions of Windows will
     be NT-based (whatever Microsoft decides to call them).

     Whether you are running a DOS-based or an NT-based version of Windows,
     what you see when Windows starts is called the Shell.  The default Shell
     that modern versions of Windows use is a program called Explorer
     (EXPLORER.EXE).  By default, the Explorer Shell has an aqua blue
     background with a bunch of icons sitting on it and a "Start" button in
     the lower left corner.  Most people think that Explorer is unique to
     Windows, and that it's the only Shell that Windows can use, and that, in
     effect, the Explorer Shell "IS" the Windows Operating System.  Nothing
     could be further from the truth.

     The same thing holds true for DOS.  The default Shell that DOS uses is a
     program named COMMAND.COM, and it provides the familiar "C:\>" command-
     line prompt.  Most people think that the command-line Shell provided by
     the COMMAND.COM program "IS" DOS.  It's not.  It's just one of many
     Shells that you can get for the DOS Operating System.  An Operating
     System simply provides services that other programs (like the Shell) can
     use to use to get access to the computer's hardware (memory, hard drive,
     keyboard, mouse, video card, etc.).  You do not ever actually "see" the
     Operating System -- you "see" the Shell.


     If you are using a DOS-based version of Windows, Windows is not an
     Operating System, and Windows is not even a DOS Shell.  Windows is
     nothing more than a really big, really slow, DOS program (much like any
     other DOS program).  When you turn your computer on, the DOS Operating
     System loads, which in turn loads the DOS Shell (COMMAND.COM by
     default).  You can play around in DOS for awhile doing things (running
     DOS programs) if you want.  When you decide you want to use the DOS
     program called Windows, you simply run the DOS executable file named
     WIN.COM.  This starts the Windows Environment, which in turn loads the
     Windows Shell program (by default, EXPLORER.EXE on newer versions of
     Windows and FILEMAN.EXE on older versions).  Try this, if you don't
     believe me:  Edit the C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM.INI file, changing the line that
     says "SHELL=EXPLORER.EXE" or "SHELL=FILEMAN.EXE" to "SHELL=COMMAND.COM". 
     It will blow your mind (PLEASE don't try this if you're squeamish about
     how to "restore" SYSTEM.INI back to "normal" again, though).

     The more recent DOS-based versions of Windows go to great lengths to
     make sure Windows loads automatically, so that you never actually see
     the DOS C:\> prompt, so that you don't believe you're really running
     DOS, so that you believe Windows is an Operating System.  But the real
     Operating System is DOS, no matter what Microsoft wants you to believe.

     SLOWING DOWN WINDOWS AND WINDOWS-NATIVE APPLICATIONS
     ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

     SLOWDOWN is a DOS program, and is designed to work with DOS programs. 
     If you are using a DOS-based version of Windows (1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 9x, or
     ME), you can use SLOWDOWN to Slow Down Windows and Windows-native
     applications.  Just as with any other DOS program, though, you must
     install SLOWDOWN into memory BEFORE you start Windows.  You typically do
     that in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, with a simple "SLOWDOWN" line.  A
     "SLOWDOWN" line (with no Options) in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file will install
     SLOWDOWN into memory, but it will not do anything to Slow Down the
     computer just yet.  Later on, when you actually want things to run
     Slowly, is when you tell SLOWDOWN exactly what to do.

     Here is the quirk you have when you try to use a DOS Program to Slow
     Down Windows, though.  Windows itself is the DOS application that
     SLOWDOWN Slows Down.  Windows-native programs, for all practical
     purposes, are "invisible" to DOS (and, therefore, "invisible" to
     SLOWDOWN).  As far as DOS is concerned, whenever you start a new
     Windows-native application, you are simply "extending" or "growing"
     Windows (causing it to consume more resources than it did before).  As
     far as SLOWDOWN (DOS) is concerned, it is all just one big, slow DOS
     application called Windows.

     Because SLOWDOWN cannot tell which Windows-native application is running
     at any particular instant, it cannot treat each one differently (like it
     can with DOS programs).  Basically, with SLOWDOWN, either EVERYTHING in
     Windows is Slowed Down or NOTHING is Slowed Down.  Also, because Windows
     so completely and obtrusively controls the keyboard, it's not possible
     to use the SLOWDOWN Hot-Keys to control the Speed while Windows is
     running.  SLOWDOWN does in fact let you control the Speed that Windows
     is running, but you must do it manually (from a DOS command-line running
     inside a DOS Box).

     The way you control the Speed that Windows runs is from the DOS command-
     line.  You use the same basic format for SLOWDOWN Options as you do to
     Slow Down a "regular" DOS program, but you preface the Option with a "W"
     or a "WINDOWS".  For example, to have Windows (and all Windows-native
     programs) run at approximately the same speed as a 100-MHz 486, you
     would something like this:

       SLOWDOWN /WindowsMHz486 = 100     or
       SLOWDOWN /WMHz=100










                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 48 of 75



     Only the Options that make sense as specifically applying to Slowing
     Down Windows are the ones you can preface with a "W" or a "Windows". 
     Those Options are:

       /WindowsMHz80486=nnn  (Run Windows at same Speed as nnn-MHz 80486)
       /WindowsMHz80286=nnn  (Run Windows at same Speed as nnn-MHz 80286)
       /WindowsMHz8088=nnn   (Run Windows at same Speed as nnn-MHz 8088)
       /WindowsSpeed=nnn     (Run Windows at a Speed of nnn SlowDown Units)
       /Windows=nnn          (Slow Down Windows by nnn SlowDown-Units)

       /WindowsUseInt08      (Use Interrupt 08 to Slow Down Windows)
       /WindowsUseInt70      (Use Interrupt 70 to Slow Down Windows)

     There are some other Options that, at first glance, you might think
     could apply to Slowing Down Windows.  Here is what they are and why (at
     least in my mind) they don't apply to Windows.  You can NOT preface
     these with a "W" or "WINDOWS":

       /XT or /AT       (trust me, you NEVER want to run Windows this slow)
       /RememberSpeed   (Can't be set by keyboard from inside Windows)
       /UseTraceMode    (Trace Mode crashes Windows)
       /UseCPUCache     (The Cache can't be controlled underneath Windows)
       /ShiftMask=mask  (Hot-Keys don't work in Windows)

     The remaining Options (/Help, /Quiet, /CPUSpeedTable, etc.) are
     "general" Options that don't have anything to do with actually Slowing
     Down the computer at all.  So, you can't preface these with a "W" or
     "WINDOWS", either.  All of the Options are discussed in detail in
     various sections up above, if you're not already familiar with them.


     In order for SLOWDOWN to have an effect on Windows, it must be installed
     into memory BEFORE you start Windows (you typically do this in your
     AUTOEXEC.BAT file).  If you do a Windows-applicable Option in the
     SLOWDOWN that you install before Windows starts (probably in your
     AUTOEXEC.BAT file), then it will affect (Slow Down) Windows while
     Windows is loading.  You usually don't want to do this, though.  Windows
     already takes an EXTREMELY long time to load, and it's usually VERY
     frustrating to make it happen any slower than it already does.

     However, there may be legitimate reasons to do it.  It's possible that
     Slowing Down Windows while it is loading could cause it to run better. 
     For example, I know there's a patch I was required to download from
     Microsoft and install for my AMD K6-2 350-MHz computer at home.  The
     symptom was that the computer would crash every time I tried to Shut
     Down (that's right, it would crash when I tried to turn it off
     "gracefully" like I was supposed to do).  I think (but am not completely
     sure) that the patch is required because the AMD CPU is too fast for
     Windows (at least too fast for Windows 95).  I never actually tried
     using SLOWDOWN to fix the problem, but it might have worked, and I might
     not have needed to install the Microsoft "fix".


                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 49 of 75



     Usually, the more appropriate way to use SLOWDOWN with Windows is to
     change the Speed of the computer after Windows has already started. 
     What you must do is open up a DOS Box underneath Windows (Windows
     usually calls it an "MS-DOS Prompt"), and run SLOWDOWN with the
     appropriate Windows-related Options from inside the DOS Box.  The
     SLOWDOWN that is inside the DOS Box actually can't do anything to Slow
     Down Windows, though.  The SLOWDOWN that was installed BEFORE Windows is
     the one that actually does the Slowing Down.  The SLOWDOWN you run from
     inside the DOS Box simply "tells" the SLOWDOWN that was installed before
     Windows what to do.

     It is possible to "automate" the process of starting a Windows-native
     application Slowly using SLOWDOWN.  I will assume already that you're
     running a DOS-based version of Windows, and also that you installed
     SLOWDOWN into memory before you loaded Windows.  What you then need to
     do is create a DOS batch file with lines similar to the following:

       RUNPROG.BAT:
         @ECHO OFF
         SLOWDOWN /WindowsMHz=100
         C:\DIR\PROGRAM
         PAUSE
         SLOWDOWN /Windows=0

     where C:\DIR\PROGRAM is the drive (C:), directory (\DIR\), and file name
     (PROGRAM) of the Windows executable file (usually with a .EXE extension)
     that loads the Windows-native program you want to run slowly.  Then when
     you want to run the PROGRAM, instead of running the PROGRAM.EXE file
     directly like you used to do, you run this batch file instead.  A batch
     file is literally an executable file (one that you can easily create
     yourself), so can drag the batch file to your desktop and create
     shortcuts to it and add it to your menus and do all of the other stuff
     you can normally do with ANY executable file.

     In order to run a batch file, Windows must open up a DOS Box.  You can
     either execute the batch file from a DOS Box that you have already
     opened, or you can tell Windows to execute the Batch file.  If you tell
     Windows to execute it (for example, by double-clicking on it from File
     Manager or Windows Explorer), then Windows will automatically open up a
     DOS Box for you.

     The Batch file tells SLOWDOWN to run Windows at approximately the same
     speed as a 100-MHz 486, and then executes "C:\DIR\PROGRAM" (the Windows-
     native application).  When the Windows-Native application called PROGRAM
     begins to execute, Windows will automatically switch tasks, and make
     PROGRAM the new foreground application (PROGRAM will now have the
     Windows Focus instead of the Batch file).  The Batch file will still be
     executing, but it will running in the background (it will not have the
     Windows Focus).




                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 50 of 75



     After you are done using PROGRAM, and you want to speed the computer
     back up again, you will need to (manually) switch the Windows Focus back
     to the Batch File (make the Batch file the Foreground Application).  The
     Batch file has actually been running the whole time (in the background),
     and the program that the batch file is currently running is PAUSE.  The
     PAUSE program has been sitting there patiently this whole time, waiting
     for you to press a key on the keyboard.  Now that the PAUSE program has
     the Windows Focus (it is the program where Windows will send the
     keystrokes), you can press a key on the keyboard.  This will continue
     running the batch file, which then tells SLOWDOWN to run the computer at
     full speed again (SLOWDOWN /Windows=0).


     The other issue with this batch file is that if you try to task-switch
     (in Windows) between this PROGRAM and another Windows-native program
     (let's call it Program2), then Program2 will run Slowly just like
     PROGRAM does.  Depending on exactly what you're trying to do, and
     exactly what PROGRAM and Program2 are, this could cause you some grief. 
     If you simply can't live with these limitations that Windows forces
     SLOWDOWN (DOS) to live by, then you may need to get a Windows-native
     Slowdown-type program.


     Here are a few other things you should know about using SLOWDOWN to Slow
     Down Windows.  Much like in plain old DOS, the Interrupt 8 (the default)
     method works MUCH better than the Interrupt 70 method when you are
     trying to Slow Down Windows (see page 19 above if you don't know what
     that means).  I give you option to use Interrupt 70 to Slow Down Windows
     if you want, but don't recommend it.

     Also, all of the quirks and limitations detailed above only apply when
     you are trying to Slow Down Windows-NATIVE applications.  If you are
     simply using Windows as a DOS Task-Switcher, and are only trying to Slow
     Down DOS-based Applications that are running inside DOS Boxes, none of
     those limitations apply.  SLOWDOWN does a very good job (at least as
     good as any other program I've seen) of Slowing Down DOS program
     underneath Windows.


     In version 1 of SLOWDOWN, the way you Slowed Down Windows was to load
     the DOS executable file used to start Windows (WIN.COM) using the
     PROGRAM Option of SLOWDOWN, like this:

       SLOWDOWN {SlowDown Options} WIN

     While that approach could still work with this version of SLOWDOWN, I do
     not recommend it.  I haven't really experimented with it to know for
     sure, but suspect it could cause you some problems.  It is MUCH better
     to simply load SLOWDOWN as a TSR, with no Options, in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
     file (before Windows starts).  Then, you can control SLOWDOWN after
     Windows is loaded by using DOS Boxes underneath Windows.


                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 51 of 75



     PLEASE keep in mind that this entire section about Slowing Down Windows
     and Windows-native applications only applies to DOS-based versions of
     Windows (1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 9x, and ME).  If you are using an NT-based
     version of Windows, you have no choice but to use a Windows-native
     Slowdown-type program in order to Slow Down Windows-native applications. 
     You can still use SLOWDOWN to Slow Down DOS applications that you run
     inside the DOS Boxes underneath Windows, though.


     Let me also say this.  I've never actually tried using SLOWDOWN with
     Windows ME (actually, I've never tried using Windows ME at all).  ME is
     supposedly the last DOS-based Windows that Microsoft will ever make. 
     I've also heard that it is impossible to have Windows ME boot to a
     command-line Shell (like COMMAND.COM).  I have a very hard time
     believing it's really impossible (I CAN see Microsoft making it
     DIFFICULT, but not impossible).  But then again, we're talking about
     Microsoft here.  They have a long track record of doing things that
     don't make sense from a technical perspective -- many things they do
     only make sense from a marketing perspective (all they are intended to
     do is maintain and increase Microsoft's dominance of the market place). 
     Anyway, the point of this paragraph is simply to let you know that
     Windows ME is DOS-based.  Even if you are unable to see a DOS command-
     line Shell before you start Windows ME, you should still be able to load
     SLOWDOWN before you start Windows, and SLOWDOWN should work with it just
     fine.  I don't even know if Windows ME has an AUTOEXEC.BAT file, but I
     suspect that it does.  And, if you want to use SLOWDOWN to Slow Down
     Windows, you will probably want to load SLOWDOWN in AUTOEXEC.BAT.

     SLOWING DOWN DOS PROGRAMS UNDERNEATH WINDOWS
     ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

     One way you can use Microsoft Windows is as a DOS Task-Switcher.  You
     can run several DOS applications at the same time underneath Windows,
     and "switch" between them.  Windows puts each DOS application in a
     separate thing called a "DOS box", and you can use SLOWDOWN to Slow Down
     the DOS boxes that run underneath Windows.  In fact, SLOWDOWN will allow
     you to have each separate DOS box underneath Windows running at a
     separate SLOWDOWN speed, and a different SLOWDOWN "mode" (Interrupt
     8/Interrupt 70), and with the Hot-Keys configured differently, than all
     of the other DOS boxes.  Let's talk a little bit about how DOS Boxes
     work.

     If you open more than one DOS Box underneath Windows, they are almost
     totally isolated from each other.  Anything that is done to the memory
     of one DOS Box can't be seen by any of the other DOS boxes.  For
     example, if you load SLOWDOWN into memory in one DOS Box, it does not
     affect any of the other DOS Boxes that might be running at the same
     time.  Each DOS box can have its own independent copy of SLOWDOWN loaded
     into memory, and they will not affect or interfere with each other.  In
     technical terms, each DOS Box is running in a different "Virtual
     Machine."

     However, anything you do to the memory of the computer BEFORE you start
     Windows (such as a installing SLOWDOWN with your AUTOEXEC.BAT file) is
     automatically available to all DOS Boxes that DOS-based versions of
     Windows may open up after it starts.  Windows has no choice but to
     "copy" what was there before it started, because Windows is itself
     nothing more than a large, slow DOS program.  It must work with DOS
     programs (TSR's like SLOWDOWN) that were installed before it was.

     What SLOWDOWN is able to do (if you want it to) is to load a single copy
     of SLOWDOWN into memory (before Windows starts), and also to have each
     separate DOS Box running at a separate SLOWDOWN speed, using a different
     SLOWDOWN "Mode" (Interrupt 8 or Interrupt 70), and using a different set
     of Hot-Keys.  The single copy of SLOWDOWN (installed before Windows was
     started) will automatically change speeds and modes and Hot-Keys
     appropriately as you switch between the different DOS boxes.  This can
     make it seem as if you have several different copies of SLOWDOWN running
     at the same time, even though there is really only one.  SLOWDOWN will
     automatically keep track of and switch between 16 different DOS Boxes
     underneath Windows.  You can also use SLOWDOWN to Slow Down Windows
     itself, as described above in "SLOWING DOWN WINDOWS AND WINDOWS-NATIVE
     APPLICATIONS" (page 48).








                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 53 of 75



     Note that this Task-Switching capability of SLOWDOWN is only used if you
     install SLOWDOWN into memory before you start your DOS-based version of
     Windows (such as if you put a "SLOWDOWN" line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
     file).  If you do this, SLOWDOWN (including the SLOWDOWN Hot-Keys) will
     be automatically accessible in all DOS Boxes that you start underneath
     Windows.  The other choice is to install SLOWDOWN only inside the DOS
     Boxes that will actually need SLOWDOWN, but, in my opinion, that is more
     complicated and more confusing.


     Windows is not the only DOS Task-Switching program there is.  Other
     Task-Switchers include DesqView, Software Carousel, and the DOSSHELL
     program that comes with later versions of DOS (to name a few).  The
     Task-Switching capability of SLOWDOWN will only work in Windows,
     however.  If a non-Windows Task-Switching program is used, you will
     probably want to load SLOWDOWN individually in each DOS box underneath
     the Task-Switcher.  If you try to load SLOWDOWN before you load the
     Task-Switcher, SLOWDOWN won't be able to "isolate" the DOS Boxes from
     each other (and this will cause you a lot of headaches).


     Another thing to keep in mind is that "real" DOS is a LOT faster than a
     DOS Box underneath Windows.  If you actually do a comparison of the two
     with SLOWDOWN, you will see that "real" DOS is AT LEAST twice as fast as
     a Windows DOS box on the same computer.  The difference in speed is so
     significant that you need to take some special precautions when using
     SLOWDOWN with Windows.

     Let's say you install SLOWDOWN before you start Windows, and when you
     do, SLOWDOWN says the maximum SPEED of your computer is 2400 Slowdown-
     Units (SU's).  Then you start Windows, and start a DOS Box underneath
     Windows, and run SLOWDOWN again.  Let's say SLOWDOWN now tells you the
     Maximum SPEED of your computer is 800 Slowdown-Units (1/3 as fast as it
     was before you installed Windows).  When you ran SLOWDOWN the second
     time (inside the DOS box), SLOWDOWN updated itself with the new Maximum
     SPEED of the computer (now only 800 Slowdown-Units, because it is
     running in a DOS Box underneath Windows).  SLOWDOWN will continue to
     work properly in all DOS Boxes until you exit from Windows (when the
     computer will automatically speed up again).

     Let's go through another scenario.  You do the same things as before, up
     to the point where you run SLOWDOWN the second time (you install
     SLOWDOWN, start Windows, and start a DOS Box underneath Windows). 
     Instead of running SLOWDOWN a second time, though, you just try to
     change the speed of the computer with one of the SLOWDOWN Hot-Keys,
     <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<1> (which is supposed to start running the computer at 10%
     of "Normal" Speed).  The problem is, "Normal" Speed now is only 800
     SU's, but SLOWDOWN still thinks it is 2400 SU's.  This could cause your
     computer to crash (SLOWDOWN will try to Slow Down your computer more
     than it is safe to do).



                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 54 of 75



     While SLOWDOWN can automatically tell whether or not Windows is running,
     it cannot automatically tell exactly how much Windows has Slowed Down
     the DOS Boxes that run underneath it.  If you install SLOWDOWN before
     you run Windows, and don't update SLOWDOWN (by running SLOWDOWN from the
     command-line inside at least one DOS Box), SLOWDOWN will ignore any Hot-
     Key requests you try to perform.  Instead of changing the Speed of the
     computer, SLOWDOWN will instead simply beep at you twice (indicating a
     problem).  If you want the Hot-Keys to work correctly, you need to make
     sure you run SLOWDOWN at least once from a DOS Box after Windows has
     started.

     If you quit Windows and start running "real" DOS again (which you can't
     reliably do with Windows versions later than 3.x), or "Restart in MS-DOS
     Mode" (in versions of Windows later than 3.x), the opposite problem
     happens.  DOS just naturally starts running several times faster than it
     did while Windows was running.  However, SLOWDOWN can handle this
     situation automatically.  It remembers how fast the computer was before
     Windows started, and will automatically convert everything back to what
     it needs to be for "real" DOS again.


     In summary, each DOS Box can be running at a different SLOWDOWN Speed,
     using a different SLOWDOWN mode (Interrupt 8/Interrupt 70), and using a
     different configuration for the Hot-Keys (Shift-mask, Enable/Disable,
     and Beep).  You can either load a separate copy of SLOWDOWN in each DOS
     Box, or load a single copy of SLOWDOWN before Windows starts (such as
     with your AUTOEXEC.BAT file).  If you load SLOWDOWN before Windows
     starts, you will also need to run SLOWDOWN from the command-line at
     least once inside a DOS Box before SLOWDOWN will work correctly.
























                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 55 of 75



     HOW SLOWDOWN WORKS
     ออออออออออออออออออ

     Every DOS-based slowdown-type of program I've seen works essentially the
     same way.  They "tie" themselves to a Clock Interrupt (either Interrupt
     8 or Interrupt 70).  SLOWDOWN basically works the same way (see the
     /UseInt08 and /UseInt70 Options above on page 19).

     SLOWDOWN either ties itself to Interrupt 8, which occurs approximately
     18 times per second, or to Interrupt 70, which occurs approximately 1024
     times per second.  These Clock Interrupts are always occurring as long
     as your computer is turned on, even if the computer isn't "doing
     anything".  Each time one of these Interrupts occurs, SLOWDOWN "wastes"
     an appropriate amount of time by doing a series of "do-nothing" loops (a
     do-nothing loop is called a Slowdown-Unit or an SU).  Each Slowdown-Unit
     is a complicated and time-consuming set of things for the CPU (Central
     Processing Unit) to do, but doesn't provide any useful output -- it just
     wastes time (sounds a lot like Windows, doesn't it?).  Because SLOWDOWN
     is constantly wasting time (in the background) whenever there is a Clock
     Interrupt, a normal program (running in the foreground) is unable to get
     access to the CPU (your computer's "brain") as much as it normally does. 
     This makes the computer appear to run more slowly.


     In the Options you use to tell SLOWDOWN how fast (or how slow) you want
     the computer to run, you are telling SLOWDOWN (either directly or
     indirectly) how many Slowdown-Units (do-nothing loops) you want it to do
     each time there is a Clock Interrupt.  To calculate how fast your
     computer is compared to an XT or an AT or an 80486 computer, SLOWDOWN
     counts how many Slowdown-Units your computer can continuously do between
     each Interrupt 8.  SLOWDOWN knows that an XT (4.77-MHz 8088) can do
     approximately 12 Slowdown-Units between each Interrupt 8, an AT (8-MHz
     80286) can do about 54 SU's, and a 75-MHz 80486 can do about 889 SU's. 
     Because SLOWDOWN uses the same method (Slowdown-Units) to measure the
     Speed as it does to Slow Down the computer, it can simulate pretty
     accurately the Speed of almost any computer.  Note, though, that while
     SLOWDOWN attempts to simulate a particular CPU speed, the CPU speed is
     NOT the only thing that controls how fast a computer performs (though it
     is usually the main thing).














                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 56 of 75



     For example, to simulate an XT, SLOWDOWN needs to waste some time each
     Clock Interrupt.  How much time?  Well, let's assume the maximum Speed
     of your computer is 120 Slowdown-Units (SU's).  SLOWDOWN needs to leave
     enough time for your computer to do the equivalent of 12 "do-nothing"
     loops between each Interrupt 8, so SLOWDOWN will "waste" 108 (120-12)
     SU's every time there is an Interrupt 8.  This will leave 12 SU's worth
     of time for your computer to run other programs.  To simulate an AT
     (whose Speed is 54 SU's), SLOWDOWN will "waste" 66 (120-54) SU's each
     time there is an Interrupt 8.  The maximum Slowdown-Factor SLOWDOWN
     would actually use is 120.  A Slowdown-Factor of 120 would Slow the
     computer Down enough that it would be very frustrating to use, but
     should not stop the computer completely.


     No "slowdown" or Benchmark program can do a perfect job of telling you
     exactly how fast your computer will run any particular program.  Suppose
     you have a Benchmark program (or a salesman) tell you your computer is
     50 times faster than an AT.  That doesn't mean every program you have
     will run 50 times faster on your computer than it will on an AT.  Some
     programs will, in fact, run about 50 times faster.  But, some may run
     only about 10 times faster, some may run at about the same speed, some
     may actually run slower, and some may not even run at all.  It all
     depends on how the program is written and what the program is supposed
     to do.

     I'm telling you this because the default Speeds SLOWDOWN uses to
     simulate XT's and AT's and 80486's and whatever will not always work
     correctly -- you may have to experiment a little with each program (the
     SLOWDOWN Hot-Keys can help you "fine-tune" things).  If your program
     doesn't do anything too weird, SLOWDOWN's default values should work
     pretty well.  If you find values other than the defaults work better for
     a particular program, for heaven's sake write yourself a Batch file to
     automate the process for you the next time.

     One thing SLOWDOWN (and every other DOS slowdown-type program I've seen)
     doesn't always do very well is sound.  The way a PC generates sounds
     through its speaker is not very sophisticated and not very controllable,
     and sometimes SLOWDOWN has a hard time dealing with it.  It just depends
     on how the program is written.  If the funky sounds or the extremely
     long beeps bother you, and the program has the option to turn off the
     sound, you may want to do just that.












                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 57 of 75



     Interrupt 8 and Interrupt 70 (both described above on page 19) are the
     fundamental methods that SLOWDOWN that uses to Slow a computer Down. 
     Interrupt 8 is the most "compatible" method (it always works), but a
     program can be "jerky" when it is being Slowed Down with Interrupt 8. 
     This is because Interrupt 8 occurs very infrequently (only about 18
     times per second).

     Programs Slowed Down with Interrupt 70 will usually run "smoother" than
     they do with Interrupt 8, because Interrupt 70 occurs much more often
     than Interrupt 8 (about 1024 times per second).  In fact, the frequency
     of Interrupt 70 is easily programmable, and can be programmed to occur
     as often as 8192 times per second.  The problem with using Interrupt 70
     to Slow the computer Down is that it doesn't always work.  Sometimes it
     just plain doesn't work at all, sometimes it Slows the computer Down too
     much or too little, and sometimes it crashes the computer.  Also,
     changing the frequency to anything other than 1024 times per second
     (which some other slowdown-type programs do) causes even more
     compatibility problems.  When Interrupt 70 works, it's very nice.  When
     it doesn't, it's a real pain.  That's why SLOWDOWN let's you toggle back
     and forth between Interrupt 8 and Interrupt 70 any time you want.



     SLOWDOWN also has two other "methods" of Slowing Down the computer,
     (detailed above on page 21) and UseTrace (detailed above page 25). 
     These two methods are fundamentally very different than Interrupt 8 and
     Interrupt 70, though.  Because the sections above describe these methods
     in detail, I won't repeat the details here.  The important thing is that
     you know they are available, and you can refer to the sections above if
     you want to know the details.

     There is one thing you might want to know about the UseCPUCache and
     UseTrace methods, though, that isn't mentioned anywhere else.  SLOWDOWN
     will never both Disable the CPU Cache and turn on Trace Mode at the same
     time.  Under the correct circumstances, SLOWDOWN may do one or the other
     to Slow the computer Down, but it will not do both at the same time. 
     The main reason for this is that doing both at the same time makes your
     computer run unbelievably slowly.  I don't think there's a computer out
     there fast enough that could ever warrant being Slowed Down that much.

     If you want to experiment with doing both at the same time, however, you
     can do it.  You will just need to experiment with the two other programs
     that are distributed with this version of SLOWDOWN -- SLOWINT1 (which
     can turn on Trace Mode) and CPUCACHE (which can control the CPU Cache). 
     If computers ever get fast enough to warrant being slowed down that
     much, I may add the capability into SLOWDOWN.  Until then, you will need
     to use SLOWINT1 and CPUCACHE.

     EMM386.EXE AND THE CPU CACHE
     ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

     This section is going to be a pretty technical discussion about the
     USECPUCACHE Option discussed above (page 21).  In particular, it will
     describe certain compatibility issues that have been discovered between
     HIMEM.SYS/EMM386.EXE and the CPU Cache.  Note that the problems
     discovered are not actually issues with SLOWDOWN itself, but affect
     SLOWDOWN because it attempts to manipulate the CPU Cache.  This will get
     fairly technical, so if you're not currently having a problem with
     SLOWDOWN, you should be able to safely skip this section.  If your
     computer is locking up when you use SLOWDOWN, this section will
     definitely interest you.

     There have been two different issues reported with the CPU Cache and
     HIMEM.SYS/EMM386.EXE (the Extended/Expanded Memory Managers that
     Microsoft includes with later versions of DOS).  The first problem
     happens on some computers if HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE are NOT loaded in
     memory.  With these particular computers, any attempt by SLOWDOWN to
     manipulate the CPU Cache will cause the computer to lock up.  However,
     if HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE ARE loaded into memory before you try to run
     SLOWDOWN, everything works just fine.  The SLOWDOWN user that discovered
     this problem has also reported that everything works fine if the CPU
     Cache is Disabled before you run SLOWDOWN, even if you re-Enable the CPU
     Cache afterwards.

     The most obvious solution to this problem, if you have it, is to make
     sure HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE are always loaded into memory before you
     use SLOWDOWN.  Most computers these days are already set up so that
     HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE are loaded automatically (via the C:\CONFIG.SYS
     file).  So even if your computer actually has the problem, you probably
     will not even know it unless you happen to play around with the
     HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE lines in your C:\CONFIG.SYS file (which, of
     course, most people never do). 

     Unfortunately, there are also a (very) few programs out there that will
     not work correctly if HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE are installed, but the
     programs also require the use of SLOWDOWN.  If your computer has the
     problem we're discussing here (SLOWDOWN locks up the computer when
     HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE are NOT installed), and you want to run a
     program that does NOT work if HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE ARE installed,
     here is how to get around the problem.  What you need to do is Disable
     the Cache before installing SLOWDOWN into memory.  There are two
     different ways to do this.









                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 59 of 75



     The first way to do this is to Disable the CPU Cache in the BIOS (this
     will Disable the Cache every time your computer starts).  You will need
     to get into the BIOS Setup program to change this setting.  On most
     computers, this requires hitting some special keystroke combination as
     the computer is first starting (exactly how to do it varies from
     computer to computer, so you pretty much need to figure out the details
     by yourself).  In many BIOS's, the menu item referring to the CPU Cache
     is referred to the "L1 Cache".

     Of course, you normally don't want to leave the Cache Disabled
     permanently.  You really only want the Cache to be Disabled long enough
     for SLOWDOWN to get installed, and then you will want to re-Enable the
     Cache.  You can use the enclosed CPUCACHE program to do that.  If the
     Cache is Disabled in the BIOS, the following excerpt from your
     AUTOEXEC.BAT file will leave the Cache Disabled just long enough for
     SLOWDOWN to get installed, and then will re-Enable the Cache:

       SLOWDOWN            {Install SLOWDOWN into memory}
       CPUCACHE Enable     {Enable the Cache}
       SLOWDOWN            {Have SLOWDOWN recalculate the Computer Speed}


     A second way to Disable the Cache just long enough for SLOWDOWN to get
     installed is to use CPUCACHE to both Disable and Enable the Cache
     (instead of using the BIOS to Disable the Cache and CPUCACHE to Enable
     the Cache, as was done above).  The following excerpt from an
     AUTOEXEC.BAT file would do this:

       CPUCACHE Disable    {Disable the Cache}
       SLOWDOWN            {Install SLOWDOWN into memory}
       CPUCACHE Enable     {Enable the Cache}
       SLOWDOWN            {Have SLOWDOWN recalculate the Computer Speed}


     Because I do not actually own a computer that has this problem, I cannot
     verify whether both of these methods will actually work.  At least in
     theory, the first method (Disabling the Cache with the BIOS and Enabling
     it with CPUCACHE) should always work.  The second method (using CPUCACHE
     to both Disable and Enable the Cache) may or may not work on some
     computers (the computer may lock up the first time CPUCACHE tries to
     manipulate the Cache, just like it does when SLOWDOWN tries to
     manipulate the Cache).











                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 60 of 75



     There has also been a problem reported on some computers when HIMEM.SYS
     and EMM386.EXE ARE installed before you try to run SLOWDOWN (almost the
     exact opposite problem as the one discussed above).  In this case, the
     problem actually appears to be a bug in certain versions of
     HIMEM.SYS/EMM386.EXE.  In particular, the problem happens with the
     HIMEM.SYS/EMM386.EXE that came with MS-DOS version 6.22.  It does appear
     to be limited to a only a small number of MS-DOS versions, since MS-DOS
     6.20 (which was released shortly before MS-DOS 6.22) does NOT have the
     problem, and neither does MS-DOS 7.00 (which was the version that came
     immediately after MS-DOS 6.22).

     The solution to this problem is to replace the buggy versions of
     HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE.  You can download from my web site
     (http://members.aol.com/bretjohn) the versions of HIMEM.SYS and
     EMM386.EXE that were distributed by Microsoft with MS-DOS 7.10 (a.k.a
     "DOS 98 SE", the DOS that came with Windows 98 Second Edition).  You
     will need to replace the "bad" versions of HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE with
     these new versions, and everything should work just fine after you
     reboot.

     Unfortunately, simply "replacing" the bad versions of HIMEM.SYS and
     EMM386.EXE may not be as easy as it sounds.  First of all, many
     computers have more than one copy (and possibly more than one version)
     of these programs on the hard drive already.  The places they may
     typically be located are in C:\, C:\DOS, C:\WINDOWS, and
     C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND.  Copies of HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE could be in
     other places as well, but these are the most common.  And, if your
     computer does have more than one copy of these programs (which would not
     surprise me at all), you need to figure out which one is actually being
     loaded into memory when the computer is booting up.  This is exacerbated
     even further by the fact that MS-DOS 7.00 (a.k.a. "DOS 95"), MS-DOS 7.10
     (a.k.a. "DOS 98"), and probably MS-DOS 8.00 (a.k.a. "DOS ME")
     automatically try to load C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS even if you don't want
     them to.  In case you care, they also try to automatically try to load
     C:\WINDOWS\IFSHLP.SYS and C:\WINDOWS\SETVER.EXE, though those programs
     don't seem to affect SLOWDOWN.

     In addition, Microsoft doesn't seem to be very diligent about monitoring
     version numbers on HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE.  The version of EMM386.EXE
     that came with Windows 95 OSR 2 claims to be version 4.95, and so does
     the version of EMM386.EXE that came with Windows 98 SE (the one you can
     download from my web site).  Yet, if you physically compare the two
     files, they are very different from each other.  I do not know if the
     differences actually affect how the programs actually work, but I do
     know that there's no way there should be two COMPLETELY different
     Microsoft EMM386.EXE Version 4.95's floating around.  Normally, newer
     versions of software tend to be "better" than older versions, which is
     why I allow you to download the HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE that came with
     Window 98 SE instead of the ones that came with Windows 95 OSR 2.

     Because of all of this confusion that Microsoft has created surrounding
     HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE, you will need to be careful if you try to
     update them.  Because it can get so complicated, I cannot describe
     exactly, step-by-step, what you need to do.  I will give you some things
     to keep in mind, though.

     First of all, you do need to find all of the different copies of the
     programs on your hard drive.  You may only have one copy, in which case
     your life becomes quite a bit easier.  If you have more than one copy,
     you may want to get rid of some of them, since you really only need one. 
     If you do have more than one copy, you will need to figure out which
     ones are actually being loaded as your computer is booting (look inside
     your C:\CONFIG.SYS file).  Also, as with any type of computer upgrade,
     you should make a backup copy of the existing programs, just in case you
     may need to get back to where you were before you started (sometimes
     "upgrades" make things worse instead of better).  Good Luck!

     Now that I've discussed some possible solutions to the problems, I'm
     actually going to discuss in technical detail exactly what the problem
     appears to be.  I'm including the details here for anyone who might be
     having a similar problem with another program, or if you happen to use a
     non-Microsoft Memory Manager.  If you're having a problem this
     description may help you figure out exactly what the problem is so you
     can fix it.

     There are two steps involved in Disabling the CPU Cache.  The first step
     is to modify a couple of bits in a special CPU Register called CR0
     (Control Register 0).  This step does not completely Disable the CPU
     Cache, though.  What this step does is to simply prevent any new data
     from getting put into the CPU Cache.  Any data that is already in the
     Cache stays there, and the CPU will automatically use the data that's in
     the Cache whenever it can.

     The second step involved in Disabling the CPU Cache is to issue a
     special CPU Instruction, whose mnemonic is WBINVD (Write Back and
     INValiDate the cache).  What this instruction does is tell the CPU to
     write back any data in the Cache to "real" memory (so that the real
     memory has the real data), and then to mark all of the data in the Cache
     as invalid ("dirty") so the CPU won't try to use it.  Only after this
     second step is done (issuing the WBINVD instruction to the CPU) is the
     Cache truly Disabled.

     Now comes the real issue.  Unfortunately, all of the CPU instructions it
     takes to Disable the CPU Cache (Reading and Writing CR0, and WBINVD) are
     special instructions that the CPU considers "Privileged".  That is, not
     just any program is allowed to issue these instructions any time it
     wants to.  Any program trying to issue these instructions must be
     running at Privilege Level 0 (PL0).  If the CPU is running in Real Mode,
     which it is if you boot the computer to DOS and do NOT load EMM386.EXE,
     all programs run at PL0.  If this is the case, SLOWDOWN can Disable the
     Cache without any problem (on most computers, anyway).

     When EMM386 loads, it puts the CPU into Protected Mode, and DOS is
     actually running in a Virtual-80x86 (V86) machine.  Any time a program
     is running in a V86 machine, it is NOT running at PL0, and is not
     allowed to perform any Privileged instructions.  The program that's
     managing the Protected Mode processes (in this case, EMM386.EXE) is
     supposed to intercept anything "funny" that the V86 (DOS) program does,
     and handle it appropriately.  When SLOWDOWN tries to execute a CR0 or
     WBINVD Instruction from V86 (underneath EMM386), the Protected Mode
     control program (EMM386) is supposed to intercept the "illegal"
     instruction and "fix" it so the computer doesn't crash.  If EMM386 does
     not handle things appropriately, the CPU will simply stop.  This appears
     to be what's happening with the "bad" version(s) of EMM386.  The obvious
     solution is to use a "good" version of EMM386 (such as the one you can
     download from my web site, http://members.aol.com/bretjohn).

     There are many lengthy dissertations available out on the Internet (and
     elsewhere) that discuss things like Protected Mode, Real Mode, Privilege
     Levels, etc., in great detail, so I didn't try to explain all of that
     here.  I limited this discussion specifically to SLOWDOWN the CPU Cache,
     and the EMM386.EXE bug.  If you want to learn more about all of the
     other stuff, there's no end to what you can find out if you want do a
     little bit more research.

     This section also refers to another program of mine, called CPUCACHE
     (which is included with this distribution of SLOWDOWN).  CPUCACHE is a
     relatively simple program, that does just one thing -- Controls the CPU
     Cache.  It will Enable, Disable, Toggle, or simply show you the current
     status of the CPU Cache.  It includes its own documentation, so I won't
     go into details here.  It's simply available to you if you want to (or
     need to) use it.






































                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 64 of 75



     THE DOS EXEC FUNCTION AND COMMAND.COM
     อออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

     When you use the PROGRAM Option (page 29) to have SLOWDOWN execute a
     single Program (slowly), it uses a function in DOS called EXEC.  The
     EXEC function allows one program (SLOWDOWN) to call (run) another
     program (which is called the "Child program").  The Child program that
     SLOWDOWN calls is always COMMAND.COM, or whatever the COMSPEC
     Environment variable is set to (COMMAND.COM is called the "DOS Shell").

     If you type a PROGRAM name at the end of the SLOWDOWN command line
     (telling SLOWDOWN to execute just one particular PROGRAM slowly),
     SLOWDOWN Slows Down the computer, and then EXEC's a "COMMAND /C {Program
     with Options}".  When the PROGRAM is finished (actually, when
     COMMAND.COM is finished), SLOWDOWN returns the computer to the way it
     was running before it did the EXEC.

     It would also be possible for SLOWDOWN to EXEC the PROGRAM directly
     (which is what some other "slowdown" programs do), instead of using
     COMMAND.COM as a "middleman".  The reason SLOWDOWN EXEC's the DOS Shell
     instead of directly EXEC'ing the PROGRAM is three-fold.  First of all,
     being in a DOS Shell is the only way you can execute a Batch file.  You
     cannot EXEC a Batch file directly - you can only EXEC a .COM or .EXE
     file.  Batch files are far too useful and prevalent to not allow
     SLOWDOWN to work with them.

     Secondly, a DOS Shell is the only way to execute internal DOS commands
     (COPY, DEL, DIR, FOR, SET, etc.).  These internal commands are "inside"
     the DOS Shell (COMMAND.COM), and are impossible to EXEC directly.  As
     with Batch files, internal commands are far too useful to not allow
     SLOWDOWN to work with them.

     Lastly, using the DOS Shell allows all of your PATH's, file
     redirections, etc. to remain in full use.  The DOS Shell already knows
     how to use the PATH to find executable files, how to edit command line
     arguments, etc.  If SLOWDOWN didn't use the DOS Shell to handle these
     details, SLOWDOWN would become much more complicated, take up much more
     memory, and would probably have all kinds of compatibility problems.  As
     it is, SLOWDOWN uses about 4.5K of memory, plus whatever COMMAND.COM
     uses (usually around 3-8k).













                      SLOWDOWN 3.10            Page 65 of 75



     Enough with the good things about EXEC and COMMAND.COM.  There is one
     minor "gotcha" that you need to be concerned about when using SLOWDOWN
     to EXEC a Batch file.  With some versions of DOS, when the DOS EXEC
     function calls a Child program, it gives the Child a copy of the current
     Environment to use.  Instead of giving it a copy of the entire
     Environment, however, it only gives it a copy that is barely big enough
     to hold the current state of the Environment.  There is no extra space
     given to add more Environment variables to the list.

     If the Batch file you're EXEC'ing with SLOWDOWN tries to SET (create or
     modify) any Environment variables, you may get an "Out of Environment
     Space" error message.  There's probably a good reason the Batch file is
     trying to change the Environment variable, and will probably not work
     correctly if it can't SET it.  The only Batch files you sometimes have
     problems getting to work with SLOWDOWN are those that try to SET new
     Environment variables, and even then only if you are using a version of
     DOS that limits the size of the Environment (not all of them do).  As a
     rule, Batch files don't SET Environment variables (Environment variables
     are most often created in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, which runs when you
     first turn the computer on).  Batch files that don't try to increase the
     size of the Environment should work just fine.

     THE IBM INTERRUPT SHARING PROTOCOL
     ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

     Beginning with version 2, SLOWDOWN implemented something called the "IBM
     Interrupt Sharing Protocol".  The details of the Protocol are pretty
     technical, and I won't go into them here.  I'm going to try to discuss,
     at a high level, the advantages (and disadvantages) of the Protocol,
     however.  As a user of SLOWDOWN, there are some things you should know
     that are discussed here.  I'm also trying to promote the Protocol to
     other programmers, so you'll see a little bit of that bias in here,
     also.  Please bear with me.

     Most people who use DOS very much at all install several TSR's into
     memory at the same time (TSR's like DOSKEY, MSCDEX, and, of course,
     SLOWDOWN).  There are also times when, for various reasons, you may want
     to (or need to) "Disable" a particular TSR.  You may either need to
     Disable it temporarily (and will later want to "Enable" it again), or
     you may want to Disable it permanently (and would prefer to "Uninstall"
     it from memory completely).  Unfortunately, many TSR's don't have
     "Enable" or "Disable" Options, and many also do not have "Uninstall"
     Options.

     Even if they do have an "Uninstall" Option, though, it is still possible
     that they cannot be Uninstalled from memory.  It is usually not possible
     to Uninstall a particular TSR unless it was the last TSR installed into
     memory (or at least very close to the last).  You must usually Uninstall
     TSR's in the reverse order they were installed (sometimes called FILO --
     First In, Last Out).

     For example, let's say you have 6 different TSR's in memory, all doing
     different things.  You need to "Disable" TSR #4, but it doesn't have a
     "Disable" Option.  It does have an "Uninstall" Option, but it can't be
     Uninstalled because TSR's 5 & 6 are "in the way".  In order to Uninstall
     TSR #4, you must first Uninstall TSR #6 (if you can), then Uninstall TSR
     #5 (if you can), then Uninstall TSR #4 (we're assuming here that you
     can), then re-install TSR #5 (if you can), then re-install TSR #6 (if
     you can).  Or, you can edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, REMark out the line
     that installs TSR #4, reboot the computer, do the thing you need to do
     without TSR #4, then edit AUTOEXEC.BAT again, un-REMark back in the line
     that installs TSR #4, and reboot again.  Talk about a PAIN!!

     Many years ago, IBM came up with a Protocol that solves this problem
     (and it is the only Protocol I've ever seen that even attempts to solve
     this problem).  IBM calls it the "Interrupt Sharing Protocol".  It is a
     Protocol that allows any TSR to remove itself from memory at any time,
     no matter how many programs were installed after it was.  I think it is
     a very good idea.  Unfortunately, in order for it to work properly, all
     programs need to use it (not just some programs, and not just TSR's). 
     For some reason, IBM didn't promote the Protocol very much, so not very
     many programmers even know about it, and, as a result, very few programs
     use it.  I consider myself fairly savvy about DOS (I have been writing
     TSR's for over a decade), and I first stumbled across this Protocol only
     a couple of years ago.

     The way "normal" (non-Protocol-using) programs work, you can't "see
     past" the last program installed into memory to be able to modify or
     remove any previously-installed programs.  This Protocol allows you to
     "see through" the later programs to find the early programs, so that
     they can be modified or removed.  If the TSR you're trying to Uninstall
     uses the Protocol, and all of the programs installed AFTER the one
     you're trying to Uninstall also use the Protocol, you can Uninstall the
     TSR with no problem.  It doesn't matter if the TSR's installed BEFORE it
     use the Protocol or not, all that matters is the programs installed
     AFTER it.


     There is one drawback to the Interrupt Sharing Protocol, however.  When
     you Uninstall a particular TSR, if it is not the last program in memory,
     it will leave a "hole" in your memory (where the TSR used to be).  If
     you later decide to re-install the same TSR, it is VERY unlikely that it
     will get installed into the same "hole" it was in before.  In fact, it
     is VERY unlikely that you will be able to use that memory hole again for
     any program -- it will probably be lost (wasted) until you reboot the
     computer again.  If there is even a remote chance that you will want to
     use the TSR again (before you reboot the computer), you should simply
     Disable the TSR instead of Uninstalling it from memory completely.  Not
     all TSR's have Disable/Enable Options, but any TSR sophisticated enough
     to use the Interrupt Sharing Protocol probably does.

     If the Protocol is used properly, it allows much greater flexibility in
     when and where and how you use TSR's.  If not used properly, however, it
     can actually end up being less efficient than if you just use TSR's that
     don't implement the Protocol (at least in terms of memory use).  Again,
     if there is even a remote chance that you will want to use the TSR
     again, you should not Uninstall it -- you should simply Disable it. 
     Only if you are certain that you will not need the TSR again (at least
     until you reboot the computer) should you attempt to Uninstall it.

     SLOWDOWN was the first program of mine to implement the Protocol
     (SLOWDOWN just happened to be the program I was working on when I
     discovered the Protocol).  I will be updating all of my programs to
     include the Protocol at some time in the future, however.  If you want
     more information about the Protocol, go to my Home Page:

       http://members.aol.com/bretjohn

     I have information there that will allow you to download the Protocol
     details.  You can also look at the source code for SLOWDOWN, which is
     available from my Home Page.  It contains a working implementation of
     the Protocol, as well as some other stuff you might be interested in.

     A WORD FROM THE SPONSOR
     อออออออออออออออออออออออ

     SLOWDOWN is a free program.  If you like it and use it, do something
     nice for someone else in return.  I will accept niceties to myself in
     the form of $, but that is not why I wrote SLOWDOWN.  I wrote it because
     I still have and use several programs that don't work correctly on my
     new, fast computer.  I still haven't yet found another "slowdown"
     program that both does exactly what I want it to do and is free.

     You can freely copy and distribute SLOWDOWN.COM, as long as it is
     distributed along with this SLOWDOWN.DOC, and neither file has been
     modified in any way.  You cannot charge anyone in any way for SLOWDOWN,
     except to recover your actual costs for disks and shipping (you cannot
     charge for "handling").  You do need my permission to distribute
     SLOWDOWN as a "companion" to some other program.


     You can also freely download the source code for SLOWDOWN if you want. 
     It is available from my Home Page:

       http://members.aol.com/bretjohn

     I don't include the source code with the program because I want to keep
     the size of the download as small as possible, and because I know most
     people don't care about the source code anyway.  My Home Page contains
     the source code for some of my other programs as well (see "OTHER
     PROGRAMS BY BRET JOHNSON" below, page 71.

     OTHER PROGRAMS BY BRET JOHNSON
     ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

     If you like SLOWDOWN, I have written some other programs you may find
     useful.

       CLOCK
          Shows a clock on your screen all the time.  Also has two alarms
          that beep at you when it's time for an appointment.

       JOYKEYS
          Lets you use your joystick with ANY program.

       MOUSKEYS
          Lets you use your mouse with ANY program.

       PRTSCR
          Sends all of your PrintScreens to a file instead of a printer.  A
          good way to transfer data between two programs, even if they won't
          normally "talk" to each other.

       PRTSCRFF
          Modifies your PrintScreen so that each new PrintScreen gets put on
          a new sheet of paper (especially useful if you have a Laser
          printer).

       SCANCODE
          Type keystrokes automatically in the middle of other programs. 
          Helpful in getting past the "starting screens" of most programs, or
          to create macros.  Can also be used to remap the keyboard.

       SDWRGMPD
          DOS driver for a Microsoft SideWinder Digital GamePad.

       SERIAL
          Shows the status of your serial (COM) ports on screen.  Shows the
          bit rate, parity, status of the leads (DTR, DSR, etc.).  An
          excellent way to troubleshoot modem problems.

     WARRANTY
     ออออออออ

     There is no warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, supplied
     with SLOWDOWN.  As with any software, especially TSR's, it may or may
     not work with other software that you may have.  I have done my best to
     make sure SLOWDOWN won't screw anything up, but, again, there is no
     guarantee.

     If you find any "bugs" in this program, or see something that you wish
     were different, please let me know.  I can only improve SLOWDOWN if I
     know what you think needs to improve.


     HAVE FUN!

     REVISION HISTORY
     ออออออออออออออออ

     1994/10/20  v1.00

     1994/12/21  v1.01
       * Changed a small part of the do-nothing loop that would sometimes
         lock up a computer when a serial port was accessed (such as when a
         mouse was moved).

     2000/05/30  v2.00
       * Converted from a "simulated TSR" using COMMAND.COM to a true TSR.
       * Added Hot-Keys to change Speeds "on-the-fly".
       * Changed the verbiage "Speed" to "Slowdown-Factor".  The old meaning
         of "Speed" was backwards from what people normally think, and very
         often confused them.
       * Added the MHZ, PERCENT, SPEED, REMEMBER-Speed, and TABLE Options.
       * Added longhand forms for Options.
       * Added Windows multi-tasking awareness, and removed the ability to
         Slow Down Windows.
       * Allowed SLOWDOWN to be used on any computer, including XT's
         (previous versions considered an XT already "too slow").
       * Started using the IBM Interrupt Sharing Protocol, which sometimes
         allows SLOWDOWN to be removed from memory even if other programs
         were installed after it.
       * SLOWDOWN should be less "jerky" now when trying to make a really
         fast computer run really slow.
       * Lots and lots of small changes.

     2002/03/06  v3.00
       * Added use of Interrupt 70 (/UseInt8 & /UseInt70 Options).
       * Added /UseCPUCache Option.
       * Added /UseTrace Option.
       * Added /MHz286 & /MHz8088 Options.
       * Re-Added the ability to Slow Down Windows (/WindowsXXX Options)
       * Moved Hot-Keys from "system-level" (where all Programs must use the
         same Hot-Keys) to "program-level" (each program can have a different
         set of Hot-Keys).

     2002/11/24  v3.10
       * Fixed /UseInt70 (sometimes didn't work at all on some computers).
       * Added the /Beep Option, to allow SLOWDOWN to finally be quiet if you
         want it to be.
