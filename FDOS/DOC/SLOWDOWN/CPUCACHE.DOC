     WHAT IS CPUCACHE?
     อออออออออออออออออ

     CPUCACHE is a very simple DOS program that lets you easily control
     (ENABLE, DISABLE, or simply show the Status of) your CPU's Cache.  What
     the heck is a CPU Cache, and why would anybody want to control it?  I'm
     glad you asked.

     All modern computers have a CPU Cache (all computers with at least an
     80486 CPU, which includes all Pentium-class computers).  The CPU Cache
     is a chunk of memory that is "special" in two ways: it is extremely fast
     (faster than "regular" memory), and it is "close" to the CPU ("closer"
     than regular memory).  In fact, the Cache is the main thing that makes
     modern computers so much faster than older computers.

     Whenever a program requests that the CPU do something, the CPU will
     store the instructions in the Cache.  Programs, by nature, tend to do
     the exact same things over and over and over again.  So, if a program
     asks the CPU to do the same thing it did just a little while ago (which
     is pretty likely), it's possible that the instructions for what to do
     will still be in the Cache.  If so, the CPU will retrieve the
     instructions from the Cache instead of retrieving them from regular
     memory (which is much slower than the Cache), or from the hard drive
     (which is even slower than memory).  As CPU's have progressed, the
     Caches have gotten larger and faster, and do a better job of "guessing"
     what instructions the CPU may need in the near future.  This is the main
     reason that modern CPU's are so much faster than the older CPU's.  In
     fact, from what I can tell with my experimentation, the efficiency and
     effectiveness of the Cache seems to have FAR more effect on the "speed"
     of the computer than the MHz of the CPU.

     It turns out that all CPU's with a Cache have also provided a standard,
     relatively easy way to DISABLE (turn off) the Cache.  When the Cache is
     DISABLEd, the computer will run MUCH slower than it normally does
     (usually, it will run somewhere between 5% and 20% of the "normal"
     speed).  Exactly how much the computer slows down when you DISABLE the
     Cache varies significantly from computer to computer, and is just about
     impossible to accurately predict.  For now, let's just say that
     Disabling the Cache Slows the computer Down A LOT.

     By default, most computers boot up (turn on) with the Cache ENABLEd, so
     that the computer runs as fast as it can.  The only reason you really
     should have for wanting to DISABLE the Cache is if you want the computer
     to run slower (much slower) than normal.

     There are two reasons you may want the computer to run more slowly than
     it normally does.  The first reason is if you are trying to run an old
     program, designed for an old computer, and it doesn't work correctly on
     a new, fast computer.  The old program could either "blow up" on a fast
     computer, or could run in such a way that it is impossible to use.

     The second reason you may want the computer to run slowly is as a
     troubleshooting tool.  Sometimes, when you're trying to troubleshoot
     another program, the error or status messages flash by so fast on the
     screen that you can't figure out what's going on.  With the computer
     running slowly, you may be able to see what the messages say before they
     have a chance to disappear off the screen again.


     All that being said, I don't recommend that you use CPUCACHE to Slow
     Down your computer.  I have another program, called SLOWDOWN, which is
     what you should use instead.  SLOWDOWN is MUCH more sophisticated and
     MUCH more comprehensive than CPUCACHE.  SLOWDOWN gives you almost
     complete control over how exactly fast your computer runs.  The ability
     to Control (ENABLE and DISABLE) the CPU Cache is built into both
     SLOWDOWN and CPUCACHE, but SLOWDOWN Controls the Cache automatically
     based on how fast you want the computer to run.  The main reason for
     making CPUCACHE is so that you can experiment with the CPU Cache to see
     exactly what it is and how it affects your computer.  You can use
     CPUCACHE to Slow Down the computer if you want, but SLOWDOWN will
     typically do a much better job for you.

     In fact, if you've managed to get a copy of CPUCACHE and didn't get a
     copy of SLOWDOWN at the same time, then something's wrong (they are
     supposed to be distributed together).  If you didn't get a copy of
     SLOWDOWN, go to my web site and download the latest version.  The URL of
     my web site is detailed in the "WARRANTY" section below (page 8).


     In general, programs do not care whether the Cache is ENABLEd or not, so
     Disabling the Cache should not cause any compatibility problems.  The
     only program I've run across so far that has a compatibility issue with
     a DISABLEd Cache is Microsoft Windows.  If you DISABLE the Cache before
     starting Windows, Windows crashes.  In addition, Windows will not let a
     DOS Program (like CPUCACHE), running in a DOS Box underneath Windows,
     control the Cache.  Windows doesn't crash or anything, but it won't let
     the status of the Cache be changed from a DOS Box.  Therefore,
     underneath Windows, CPUCACHE doesn't work correctly (it just displays an
     error message).

     HOW TO USE CPUCACHE
     อออออออออออออออออออ

     CPUCACHE is a pretty simple program.  It only lets you do a few
     different things to the CPU Cache: ENABLE, DISABLE, TOGGLE, or show the
     current Status of the Cache.  You tell CPUCACHE exactly which of these
     things you want it to do with command-line Options.  There are actually
     several different ways to tell CPUCACHE to do the same thing, though.
     For example, to have CPUCACHE attempt to DISABLE (turn Off) the CPU
     Cache, you could do any one of the following:

       CPUCACHE D
       CPUCACHE Disable
       CPUCACHE No
       CPUCACHE N
       CPUCACHE Off
       CPUCACHE False
       CPUCACHE -

     The shorter Options (like "D" or "-") are faster and easier to type, but
     the longer ones (like "Disable") are more descriptive and are easier to
     understand as you're reading them.  You can use whichever one you want.

     The Options are not case sensitive ("CPUCACHE D" is the same as
     "CPUCACHE d", etc.).  Also, if you enter more than one Option, CPUCACHE
     will ignore all of them except the first one.  For example:

       CPUCACHE Disable Enable

     will simply attempt to DISABLE the Cache, just like you had never even
     entered the "Enable".  A simple "CPUCACHE" (with no Options at all) will
     just show the current Status of the Cache, without trying to change
     anything:

       CPUCACHE

     A CPUCACHE line with an invalid Option (anything that's not in the list
     of valid Options) will just display a help screen.  Any of the following
     examples (or anything like them) will display a help screen:

       CPUCACHE ?
       CPUCACHE Help
       CPUCACHE What???










                       CPUCACHE 1.00            Page 4 of 9



     Here are the different command-line Options, and what they do:

     * D  Disable  Off  No  N  False  -

       This will attempt to DISABLE (turn Off) the CPU Cache.  If it is
       successful, your computer will be running much slower than it normally
       does.


     * E  Enable  On  Yes  Y  True  +

       This will attempt to ENABLE (turn On) the CPU Cache.  If it is
       successful, your computer will be running at its "normal" (fast)
       speed.


     * T  Toggle  Change

       This will attempt to TOGGLE the status of the CPU Cache.  That is, if
       the Cache was ENABLEd (turned On), CPUCACHE will attempt to DISABLE it
       (turn it Off).  If the Cache was DISABLEd (Off), CPUCACHE will attempt
       to ENABLE it (turn it On).


     After CPUCACHE runs, it will display a message on the screen indicating
     what it did.  In addition, CPUCACHE returns ErrorLevels to indicate what
     happened:

     If you don't understand what ErrorLevels are or what they are for, I
     suggest you do a little bit of reading in your favorite DOS book.

     A WORD FROM THE SPONSOR
     อออออออออออออออออออออออ

     CPUCACHE is a free program.  If you like it and use it, do something
     nice for someone else in return.  I will accept niceties to myself in
     the form of $.

     You can freely copy and distribute CPUCACHE.COM, as long as it is
     distributed along with this CPUCACHE.DOC, and neither file has been
     modified in any way.  You cannot charge anyone in any way for CPUCACHE,
     except to recover your actual costs for disks and shipping (you cannot
     charge for "handling").  You do need my permission to distribute
     CPUCACHE as a "companion" to some other program.

     You can also freely download the source code for CPUCACHE.  It is
     available from my web site:

       http://members.aol.com/bretjohn

     I haven't included the source code here, to keep the size of the
     download small, and because most people don't care about source code,
     anyway.  But it's available if you want it.


     As stated above, the main reason I wrote CPUCACHE was to be a
     "companion" to my SLOWDOWN program.  CPUCACHE will let you experiment
     with the CPU Cache, so you can see exactly what it does (and what it
     doesn't) do.  I believe including CPUCACHE will allow you to use the
     "main" program (SLOWDOWN) much more effectively.  You can use CPUCACHE,
     if you want, to Slow Down your computer.  I don't recommend it, however.
     You will generally be much better off using SLOWDOWN instead.

     OTHER PROGRAMS
     ออออออออออออออ

     If you find CPUCACHE useful, I have written some other programs you may
     find even more useful.

       CLOCK
          Shows a clock on your screen all the time.  Also has two alarms
          that beep at you when it's time for an appointment.

       JOYKEYS
          Lets you use your joystick with ANY program.

       MOUSKEYS
          Lets you use your mouse with ANY program.

       PRTSCR
          Sends all of your PrintScreens to a file instead of a printer.  A
          good way to transfer data between two programs, even if they won't
          normally "talk" to each other.

       PRTSCRFF
          Modifies your PrintScreen so that each new PrintScreen gets put on
          a new sheet of paper (especially useful if you have a Laser
          printer).

       SCANCODE
          Type keystrokes automatically in the middle of other programs.
          Helpful in getting past the "starting screens" of most programs, or
          to create macros.  Can also be used to remap the keyboard.

       SDWRGMPD
          DOS driver for a Microsoft SideWinder digital GamePad.

       SERIAL
          Shows the status of your serial (COM) ports on screen.  Shows the
          bit rate, parity, status of the leads (DTR, DSR, etc.).  An
          excellent way to troubleshoot modem problems.

       SLOWDOWN
          Slows down a fast computer so you can run older programs that
          require a PC/XT or PC/AT.
