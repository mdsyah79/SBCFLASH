NOTES
   
   KEYMAN is an interactive macro recorder for use with XKEYB.

   Either XKEYB or XKEYBRES must be resident in memory before KEYMAN
   can be installed (and XKEYBRES must have a configuration file
   allocated by XKEYB).

   Once installed, press F11 to pop up the KEYMAN window. Enter a macro
   by pressing the key to assign the macro to (eg. CTRL-D), then the
   keystrokes to be assigned to the macro, then F11 again to save the
   macro.

   You can delete macro keystrokes using the BACKSPACE key. To enter a 
   BACKSPACE keystroke in the macro, use ALT-<Keypad 8>.

   To change the Hotkey (F11 by default), pop up the KEYMAN window, 
   press the hotkey again, then press the new hotkey.

   LISTXDEF.EXE can be used to save the recorded macros as a configuration
   file.
   
   Please see the manual XKEYB.TXT for further information.
