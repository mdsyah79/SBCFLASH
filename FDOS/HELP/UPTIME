 UPTIME v7.02aá       Report the amount of time the computer has been running 

         Free & Open DOS Utility by M.Aitchison@phys.canterbury.ac.nz

USAGE: UPTIME  [options]

OPTiONS:
 /B      Brief                          /D      Day of start only             
 /L[:fn] List to printer (or filename)  /S      System uptime (if under dosemu)
 /T      Time of start only             /U:x    Units:[Days|Hours|Min|S|Ticks]

ENViRONMENT VARiABLES:
 UPTIME  Specify default options, e.g. SET UPTIME=/Verbosity=16
 CLASS1=Error, CLASS2=Warn, _ANSI=NO, COMPATIBILITY=OpenDOS, LFN=NO

EXPLANATiON:
This command shows how long the system has been up and running.  The default
format is similar to (but not exactly the same as) the Unix command of the
same name, e.g.

 11:12am  up 2 hours, since 30-SEP-1997  9:22:12, 2 OpenDOS tasks
    |        |                  |           |     |
 time now    |            date of boot      |     if Taskmgr is running
           running for                   boot time
           (units automatic)

NOTES:
Unless you specify units with the /U option (e.g. /U=Seconds) the program
will choose days, hours, minutes or seconds automatically. This may mean
a loss of accuracy in the rounding-down process (in the above example, the
system had been running for 2 hours, 10 minutes and a few seconds).

To output just the amount of time the system has been running, use the /B
option (perhaps with /U).  The /B, /D, /T and /S options can be used either
individually or together to restrict the output format.

The /System option only applies with DOESEMU is running (i.e. DOS running
under Unix), and asks Linux to report the uptime (in its own format), since
the time normally reported will be based on when DOS started, not the parent
operating system.

When running under TASKMAX or TASKMGR, the number of currently active tasks
will be displayed where Unix would normally list the number of users.

The command isn't "case sensitive"... I use capitals in the documentation
simply to highlight keywords.  You may enter the command and/or its options
using capital letters or lower case or any mixture.

You can use single-letter options or the full name, and if an option can
take parameters (e.g. /A:attr) you may use ":" or "=" to specify them (but
not a space).  For instance /A:RH and /Attribute=Rh and /atr:rH are all
equivalent.

You can set the CLASS1 and CLASS2 environment variables to override what the
program does when "fatal" and "non-fatal" conditions are encountered instead
of ending the programm or outputting a warning message to stderr respecively.
Setting CLASS1=W asks the program to continue with a warning message when an
error (such as a disk reading error) would normally have stopped the program.

You can use:
    Ignore - program continues without a warning message if possible
             (all the following will set the ERRORLEVEL > 0)
    Warning - a warning message is written to "stderr" (your screen);
              if the /L option has been used to list to the printer
              at most ONE warning message will also be written there.
    Error   - the program stops after writting an error message to "stderr"
    Abort   - the program stops without writing an error message
    Reboot  - the program halts the computer (if possible) after the message
