NAME

   LISTXDEF - List all current XKeyb key allocations to STDOUT

SYNOPSIS

   LISTXDEF


RELATED COMMANDS

   XKEYB        Main version of XKEYB 
   XKEYBRES     "Lite" version of XKEYB
   KEYMAN       XKeyb macro recorder

NOTES
   
   LISTXDEF is used to output (to STDOUT) the definition file currently
   being used by XKeyb (including any keys defined using KEYMAN.EXE).

   It is most commonly used to save a custom definition file (ie. one created
   by loading one of the standard definition files with XKEYB then assigning
   additional macros using KEYMAN).

   This is done using the command:

      KEYMAN >xyz.KEY
      
   Please see the manual XKEYB.TXT for further information.
