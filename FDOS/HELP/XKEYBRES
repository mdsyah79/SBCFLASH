NAME

   XKEYBRES - Extended Keyboard driver for MS-DOS

SYNOPSIS

   [LOADHI] XKEYBRES


RELATED COMMANDS

   XKEYB        Standard version of XKEYB 
   KEYMAN       Interactive macro recorder
   LISTXDEF     Lists current definition file to STDOUT

NOTES
   
   This version of XKEYB is more suitable for loading into upper memory
   than XKEYB.EXE, due to its smaller size. This smaller size has been
   achieved by removing most of the initialisation routines, so once it
   is installed you need to use XKEYB to load a configuration file and
   activate the driver. 

   Please see the manual XKEYB.TXT for further information.
