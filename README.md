"# SBCFLASH" 
Project SBCFLASH v2 is a flashing tool of existing CF cards used in SBC (Single Board Computer) to a new format, in Seagate MDW Testers.
Project SBCFLASH is a refresh of the ORIGINAL flashing station which runs on Legacy MSDOS. Refresh meaning Legacy MSDOS is replaced by the more powerful and modular
design of DOS alternative called: FreeDOS. Through FreeDOS, advanced ops can be done to newer version of flashing for newer machines. This saves time, money and most of all, wastes borne out of human-errors.

Existing solutions of advanced CF card flashing (for newer machine) consists of USB CF card reader connected to Windows PC. Problems with this method are as follows:
  1- Slow (Low bus speed)
  2- Damage due to mis-handling (human error)
  3- File corruption due to software issues
  4- Wrong flashing file (human error)
  
Please take note that Syslinux is used to created the bootable media and FREEDOS has the capabilities to integrate GREP and SED UNIX commands into DOS, hence providing powerful line by line searching and deletion/addition of unwanted lines of codes in the CF cards. And UNIX style FSCK function called: DOSFSCK to repair the CF card inode and metadata or any irregularities with the CF card memory structure so that the CF card can perform reliably and efficiently.
